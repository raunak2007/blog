<li>SThe college board's grade and mine disagree in a few ways. I felt like mine was a little harder. whenever a description or code fragment is requested in an inquiry. I wouldn't notice anything when I looked at the question. The student may have clarified it elsewhere in their response, though. Additionally, I wasn't entirely sure where sequencing, selection, and iteration were located. I made an effort to find it, but I was forced to deduce it from the video.</li>
<li>My program will have to be quite intricate and capable of having a significant output input, function, and goal. It can't only be an information forum. It must have a function.</li>
<li>The original CPT failed to adequately describe the goal. It is crucial that on understanding the distinction between purpose and function. The objective of the program is purpose. Function is the means through which it is accomplished. A card game of some form could serve as the function and the purpose could be enjoyment. Additionally, this same project did a poor job of explaining things.</li>

<li>I think my grade is on par with the marks the College Board gave the example projects. I am well aware of the requirements and what my project needs to succeed. My project must be complete, with a variety of features and abstraction, in order to satisfy all the requirements. I think I understtod most of the topics but some of the things I got confused on were related to the identification of lists and parameters. Sometimes it can be hard to distinguish between them but overall I feel that I learned a lot of new information. </li>
