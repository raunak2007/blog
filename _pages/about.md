Hi! I'm Raunak Mondal, and I'm a rising senior at Del Norte High School who loves applying **math and creative problem-solving** to **real-world problems**. As someone who has enjoyed learning about different cultures throughout both the United States and the rest of the world, I have always wanted to explore reams of sociopolitical data using data analysis methods and I am glad that I have the opportunity to do so through this blog. This blog contains many of the different explorations that I have done in my free time, and I hope you are enlightened by any of the posts that you encounter in my blog.
