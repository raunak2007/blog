<ul>
  <li>When it comes to engineering, there is an extensive use of science, math, logic, and algorithms to solve problems</li>
  <li>Engineering can change the world (and has a good salary!), which inspired Suma to pursue a career in that field (specifically electronics and communication)</li>
  <li>There are a variety of streams you can take with engineering, such as biomedical, aerospace, software, electronics and communication, and many more</li>
  <li>Suma’s very first job made her nervous at first, but over time, it became easier to mingle with the other students and share exepriences with one another</li>
  <li>Qualcomm is a corporation that creates services related to networking and wireless technology
    <ul>
      <li>Designs wireless telecommunications products</li>
      <li>Integrated GPUs</li>
      <li>Artifical intelligence products</li>
      <li>Inventors of CDM technology</li>
      <li>Wants to bring benefits of mobiles to other domains of engineering</li>
      <li>It is more than just sitting in front of a laptop!</li>
      <li>Volunteering + fun team activities</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Nisha - director of engineering at Qualcomm</li>
  <li>As a kid, Nisha was fascinated by how engineers made useful, innovative products</li>
  <li>Fell in love with computer-related engineering because of how well she was doing in math in high school</li>
  <li>Initially did not know what she was doing going into engineering</li>
  <li>Excited to move to San Diego because that was a city where Qualcomm existed and where the headquarters of her team company were</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="questions">
<a class="anchor" href="#questions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Questions</h1>

<p>How do you know what side of engineering you want to pursue (software, hardware, etc.)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Keep a growth mindest!</li>
  <li>It is important to know what you love</li>
  <li>It can be hard to know what your interests are, so it is a good idea to do some research and see what fields resonate the most with you</li>
  <li>More exposure may allow you to narrow down some of the things that you like the most</li>
</ul>

<p>What is the difference between software and hardware engineering?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hardware - designs the electronics, develop chips using languages</li>
  <li>Software - write the software for the electronics</li>
</ul>

<p>What universities specialize in software engineering?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Most universities with engineering will have a software engineering field (i.e. cpmputer science)</li>
  <li>In Calfiornia, we have many universities with great university programs</li>
</ul>

<p>What are majors that would help me learn the necessary skills and concepts to get a software developer job in tech app companies?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Any tech company (Google, Amazon, Apple, etc.) looks for software engineers</li>
</ul>

<p>What should I do in high school to increase my chances to get admitted into these universities?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Challenge yourself when you are in school</li>
  <li>Go above and beyond, take honors classes</li>
  <li>Take some community college classes in your junior and senior years of high school</li>
  <li>Colleges look very closely at acadmeic rigor</li>
</ul>

<p>What is one thing you wish you had done earlier that would have greatly helped you with engineering?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Take advantage of any programs that your school may have</li>
  <li>This way, you will be better prepared for engineering</li>
</ul>

<p>What were some of your biggest challenges and how did you handle them?</p>

<ul>
  <li>When Suma gave birth to her first kid, she had to focus on her kid</li>
  <li>Difficult for her to balance between motherhood and work, but with time, she got better at it</li>
  <li>Back then, one could not Google resources to help them with engineering</li>
</ul>

<p>What are some competitions that I can participate in where I can apply what I have learned?</p>

<ul>
  <li>See if you can join the first Robotics program</li>
  <li>Try to find a team in the community that you live in</li>
  <li>Gaming companies in San Diego (i.e. Rocket League)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="personal-takeaways-from-the-event">
<a class="anchor" href="#personal-takeaways-from-the-event" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Personal Takeaways from the Event</h1>

<p>After attending the event, I was really fascinated to listen to each of the engineers’ stories, as hearing them made me realize that the journey to become an engineer is a lot of work. I also liked hearing the speakers talk about Qualcomm, as personally, my dad has worked there as a software engineer for many years. Overall, this event has inspired me to possibly pursue a career in some type of engineering, as I know that there are many of opportunities for aspiring engineers like me.</p>
