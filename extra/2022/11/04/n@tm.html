<p>I completed the Final Test for AP Computer Science Principles at Friday night from 10:30 to 11:30 right before I slept. My performance was definitely skewed by the conditions of my test, as I got a 48/50 and incorrectly answered easier questions related to actions that DevOps (a role that I had) would have experience in. This is my entire performance summary as provided by AP Classroom:

As shown above, the only questions I missed was #16 and #17. This is the overview of my performance for each question:

For question 16, I chose A because I read the the first 6 words (“The message is broken into packets”) and chose that answer. However, I didn’t realize that there was another answer that also had those first 6 words but had a different second part. I understand why that answer would make sense because if computers had to receive messages as shown in choice A, they would become way more inefficient and the development of large-scale social media networks (such as Discord).

For question 17, I chose A because I used the literal definition of a protocol to select my answer. However, I didn’t realize that open protocols also involved the first part of word (“open”) and would provide a way to standardize data transmission between different devices. In addition, protocols are agreed-upon sets of rules that specify the behavior of a system. Protocols used on the Internet enable devices from different manufacturers to communicate in a standard way.</p>

<p>Night at the Museum (N@TM) was on November 3, 2022. There were four time slots for the different classes, and we (period 5 Yeung) had to be at the event to present our work from 7:00pm-7:30pm. Me and another teammate decided to bring our laptops to the event so that we could show curious people and the teacher our final project. Mr. Mortensen said that we needed to bring someone with us to the event, so I decided to bring my older brother with me so that he too could see our work. All of us had the opportunity to present to guests who attended the event, and the room was very crowded with teams from both classes having their laptops out. After the teacher saw our project functioning the way it was supposed to and showing our work to everybody, we all left the room to go and look at work from other electives.</p>

<p>After our time to present ended, we all went around to other electives to check out their work, such as 3D Animation, Ceramics, AP Studio Art, and many more. I was fascinated by what I was seeing and was amazed at how talented students around my age can be with their art work. I could very much see a lot of effort and dedication was put into the pieces that I saw, and it overall made me feel inspired to start approaching any art-related activites with a positive mindset.</p>

<p>Here are pictures of some of the artwork that I took at N@TM! I hope you like them as much as I did! :)</p>
