Layouts Folder . This folder contains a base.html and two fragments: footer.html and nav.html. These files form the standards for each HTML page in this Web Application project. The layouts/base.html is structural beginning file for index.html, greet.html, birds.html or any future file added to this project. This connection is made at the top of each HTML template, layout:decorate=”~{layouts/base}”. . As you look at the contents of the layouts/base.html think of it as the structure and common contents that will be in every HTML file. As you look back at the index.html, consider that it is starting with layouts/base.html and inserting its page specific fragments for the head and body. . Thymeleaf will put all these things together through a pre-process step. In the end, every HTML pages that is given to the Web Browser has style and structure from layouts/base, but content from its own HTML head and body. . &lt;!-- This page is illustrative and contains ideas about HTML layouts --&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt; &lt;html xmlns:layout=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; xmlns:th=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;!-- Required meta tags --&gt; &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt; &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no&quot;&gt; &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot; /&gt; &lt;!-- JQuery CSS --&gt; &lt;script th:src=&quot;@{https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js}&quot; integrity=&quot;sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;!-- Bootstrap CSS --&gt; &lt;link th:href=&quot;@{https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css}&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; integrity=&quot;sha384-EVSTQN3/azprG1Anm3QDgpJLIm9Nao0Yz1ztcQTwFspd3yD65VohhpuuCOmLASjC&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- Project CSS --&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; th:href=&quot;@{/scss/custom.css}&quot;&gt; &lt;th:block layout:fragment=&quot;head&quot; th:remove=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;Head details are added by ThymeLeaf layout consumer&lt;/th:block&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;th:block th:replace=&quot;layouts/nav :: header&quot; th:remove=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;Standard header and Navigation&lt;/th:block&gt; &lt;th:block layout:fragment=&quot;body&quot; th:remove=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;Body details are added by ThymeLeaf layout consumer&lt;/th:block&gt; &lt;th:block th:replace=&quot;layouts/footer :: footer&quot; th:remove=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;Standard footer&lt;/th:block&gt; &lt;!-- Bootstrap 5.0 Bundle with Popper --&gt; &lt;script th:src=&quot;@{https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js}&quot; integrity=&quot;sha384-MrcW6ZMFYlzcLA8Nl+NtUVF0sA7MsXsP1UyJoMp4YLEuNSfAP+JcXn/tWtIaxVXM&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;th:block layout:fragment=&quot;script&quot; th:remove=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;&lt;/th:block&gt; &lt;/html&gt; . Resources Overview . . Resources are structure in standard directories for many reasons: familiarity amongst developer, tool defaults, deployment defaults, cache optimizations, etc. Here are some of introductions: . static/images - this is where a web server typically expects images that do not change after deployment. Service in deployment will cache these files for quick loading over the internet. | static/sccs - these are cached as well. This location and the sccs name state this will work with node tools. The standard is called Sassy and is the same as used in Python Flask projects. | templates/error - error pages can be placed here. Can you guess were you would put a 500 error page. | application.properties - this resource is used to define defaults for the application. Most of these default are used by backed, for instance this will be used to define location of a database. This is similar to __init__.py. | . . With all of this in place, we can spin up the development container inside VS Code. Then, from the VS Code terminal in our Docker container environment, we can run docker-compose up in the root of our project. This will start up our individual service containers on the host machine. But, thanks to the shared network and volumes, we can continue to edit code in our development container and see the changes immediately show up on our services! . It’s also possible to use the Docker CLI to shut down or restart services as needed in development. You can even open another VS Code window and use the Remote-Containers extension to connect to one of the running service containers to directly inspect logs, edit code within that constrained environment, etc. This is a generic setup that can work for any project. Onboarding new developers requires just installing VS Code and Docker and then cloning the repository and opening it in a container. The initial setup is a lot of work, but I think this is the cleanest development experience you can get with Docker right now. .",

I have obtained the skill of leadership, as I was the Scrum Master of the RECS group in the second trimester of this year as well as the Dev Ops Lead of the Hectic 6 group in the third trimester of the year. In the former experience, I was responsible for delegating group duties to the rest of my group members and unifying my group members around a central goal, which wasn’t easy compared to other groups given that unlike other groups, my teammates didn’t personally know each other initially. In addition, I’ve learned how to facilitate frontend, backend, and Dev Ops in a major team to the standards of a professional website. . Highs and lows from year . Highs: I took on a massive leadership role in my Trimester 2 group and pulled through with a great project, including several features integrated with APIs coming from important organization such as OpenWeatherMap. Lows: There were definitely some late nights full of stress, but in the end I managed to pull through. One example is when my first trimester AWS deployment was going off the rails and our devops and I couldn’t figure out anything that would fix it (this was before ChatGPT). We were able to redo the entire deployment and luckily it worked after that. . Future plans with CompSci and Education/Career . I have decided on a year-long internship for next year. One of my family friends is the director of the San Diego Supercomputer Center and is looking for Comp Sci interns, and most of my other family friends have gone to him for CS internships and experience. I’m also planning on minoring in Data Science or pursuing in some way after high school. I don’t know if I’m committed enough to be a Comp Sci major, because I’m very interested in Data Science and it is a less competitive major in general, but I definitely want to pursue both interests. In terms of education, I strive for a BS in Computer Science and something in Data Science as well. To be honest, I haven’t thought very long or hard about my entire career, but I also know I have a lot of time to experiment in my life. . other, you pick . I have learned a lot from the culture of CS at Del Norte. One aspect that I love the most is the increased presence of project-based learning rather than pencil-on-paper tests.

Answer B, which states that “first = 100, second = 200”, is incorrect. The variable second, while initially assigned the value 200, is later assigned the value of temp, which is 100. Answer A, which states that “first = 100, second = 100”, is correct. The variable first is initially assigned the value 100 and the variable second is initially assigned the value 200. Next, temp is assigned the value of first, which is 100. Next, second is assigned the value of temp, which is 100. Last, first is assigned the value of second, which is 100. After execution, both first and second have the value 100. . Question 12: . Answer D is incorrect. For each iteration of the loop, this code segment moves the robot forward if there is an open square in front of the robot. Otherwise, the robot rotates left. In the first five iterations of the loop, the robot moves forward five squares to the top of the grid. In the next two iterations of the loop, the robot rotates left two times. In the next five iterations of the loop, the robot moves forward five squares to the bottom of the grid. In the next two iterations of the loop, the robot rotates left two times. The robot continues in an infinite loop, repeatedly moving from the bottom of the grid to the top of the grid and back. Answer C is correct. For each iteration of the loop, this code segment rotates the robot left if there is an open square to its left. Then, whether or not the robot rotates left, the code segment attempts to move the robot forward one square. In the first three iterations of the loop, the robot moves forward three squares from its initial location. In the next iteration of the loop, it rotates left. In the next three iterations of the loop, it moves forward three squares. In the next iteration of the loop, it rotates left. In the last three iterations of the loop, it moves forward three squares to the gray square at the bottom left corner of the grid. . Question 23: . Answer C, which states that “The Internet requires all communications to use encryption protocols.”, is incorrect. The Internet was not designed to be completely secure. Encryption is not required for communications. Answer B, which states that “The Internet is designed to scale to support an increasing number of users.”, is correct. The Internet was designed to be scalable, using open protocols to easily connect additional computing devices to the network. . Question 63: . Answer B, which states that “(NOT input1) AND (NOT input2)”, incorrect. For example, when input1 is true and input2 is false, then (NOT input1) will be false and (NOT input2) will be true. Therefore, (NOT input1) AND (NOT input2) will be false instead of the intended value true. Answer A, which states that “(NOT input1) OR (NOT input2)”, is correct. When input1 and input2 are both true, the expressions (NOT input1) and (NOT input2) are both false, so (NOT input1) OR (NOT input2) will evaluate to false. In all other cases, either (NOT input1) or (NOT input2) (or both) will evaluate to true, so (NOT input1) OR (NOT input2) will evaluate to true. . Question 69: . Answer A, which states that “Determining the chronological order of the photos”, is correct. The time and date that a photo is taken is considered metadata about the image. This information can be used to determine the chronological order of the images. Answer D, which states that “Determining whether two photos were taken at the same location on different days”, is correct. The location and date that a photo is taken is considered metadata about the image. This information can be used to determine whether two pictures were taken at the same location on different dates. .",

Answer choice D, which states that “the program cannot represent integers; the integers are converted into decimal approximations, leading to rounding errors”, is incorrect because while fractions are sometimes represented by decimal approximations that are subject to rounding errors, integers are not. Answer choice C, which states that “the program can only use a fixed number of bits to represent integers; the computed sum is greater than the maximum representable value”, is correct because overflow errors occur when an arithmetic operation results in a value outside the range of numbers that can be represented by a fixed number of bits. . Question 6: . Answer choice D, which states that neither program I nor program II correctly moves the robot to the gray square, is incorrect because program I correctly moves the robot to the gray square by repeatedly moving the robot forward, rotating left, moving forward twice, and rotating right. Program II correctly moves the robot to the gray square by moving the robot forward to the bottom right corner of the grid, rotating left, moving the robot forward to the upper right corner of the grid, rotating left, and moving forward to the gray square. Answer choice C, which states that both program I and program II correctly move the robot to the gray square, is correct because Program I correctly moves the robot to the gray square by repeatedly moving the robot forward, rotating left, moving forward twice, and rotating right. Program II correctly moves the robot to the gray square by moving the robot forward to the bottom right corner of the grid, rotating left, moving the robot forward to the upper right corner of the grid, rotating left, and moving forward to the gray square. . Question 10: . Answer choice D is incorrect because this code segment initially sets cost to 6, then increases cost by 2 for people who are either going on a guided tour or whose age is greater than 12. Because of the ELSE statement, the cost is not properly set for people who are both older than 12 and going on a guided tour. Answer choice B is correct because this code segment initially sets cost to 6 (the cheapest possible ticket price), then increases cost by 2 for people whose age is greater than 12. Regardless of the person’s age, cost is increased by 2 for people going on a guided tour. . Question 15: . Answer choice C, which states that Program A and program B display the same number of values, but the values differ, is incorrect because while the two programs initialize i to different values, the same values are printed inside the loop because program A prints i and then increments it and program B increments i and then prints it. Answer choice A, which Program A and program B display identical values in the same order, is correct because Program A initializes i to 1. Inside the loop, it prints i and then increments i. The loop terminates when i is greater than 10, which occurs after 10 is printed. Program A prints 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. Program B initializes i to 0. Inside the loop, it increments i and then prints i. The loop terminates when i equals 10, which occurs after 10 is printed. Program B prints 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. . Question 36: . Answer choice B, which states that the updated model is likely to decrease the runtime of the simulation because simulations that use older models tend to require more time to run than simulations that use newer models, is incorrect because whether the model is older or newer is not related to the amount of time it will take to run a simulation. Answer choice A, which states that the updated model is likely to decrease the runtime of the simulation because the time required for simulations generally depends on the complexity of the model used, is correct because the time required for a simulation to run is impacted by the level of detail used in the model. Generally, a simulation based on a less detailed model will require less time to run. . Question 53: . Answer choice A, which states that a mobile application and collar that uses GPS technology to determine the pet’s location and transmits the location when the owner refreshes the application, is incorrect because this system uses GPS technology to find a lost pet, rather than the contributions of many individuals. Answer choice C, which states that a mobile application that allows users to report the location of a pet that appears to be lost and upload a photo that is made available to other users of the application is correct because this system uses an application to enlist the services of a large number of people to help find a lost pet. .",

The “http” layer is an application layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack, used for communication between web browsers and web servers. It is the protocol used for transmitting data over the World Wide Web. . The “transport” layer (TCP) is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications running on different hosts. The TCP protocol segments the data into smaller chunks called “segments”. Each segment contains a sequence number that identifies its position in the original stream of data, as well as other control information such as source and destination port numbers, and checksums for error detection. . The “ip” layer is responsible for packetizing data received from the TCP layer of the protocol stack, and then encapsulating the data into IP packets. The IP packets are then sent to the lower layers of the protocol stack for transmission over the network. . The “network” layer is responsible for routing data packets between networks using the Internet Protocol (IP). This layer handles tasks such as packet addressing and routing, fragmentation and reassembly, and network congestion control. . Fault Tolerance . Watch both Daily videos for 4.2 .

The backend is naturally distributed as it typically consists of multiple servers, each responsible for handling different tasks or services. By distributing the backend, the application can handle a large number of requests, improve performance and reliability, and provide fault tolerance and high availability. The frontend, on the other hand, is typically executed on a single client device, such as a web browser or mobile app, and is responsible for displaying the user interface and interacting with the user. . | Analyze this command in Docker: ENV GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS=&quot;--workers=1 --bind=0.0.0.0:8086&quot;. Determine if there is options are options in this command for parallel computing within the server that runs python/gunicorn. Here is an article . | . In the context of a Docker image that runs a Python/Gunicorn web application, this command is used to configure the Gunicorn web server. The –workers option specifies the number of worker processes that Gunicorn should spawn to handle incoming requests. In this case, the value is set to 1, which means that Gunicorn will use a single worker process to handle all requests. The –bind option specifies the IP address and port number that Gunicorn should bind to, in this case, 0.0.0.0:8086, which means that Gunicorn will listen on all network interfaces on port 8086. . To enable parallel computing in Python/Gunicorn web application, you can adjust the –workers option to a higher value, which will spawn multiple worker processes to handle incoming requests concurrently. However, increasing the number of worker processes may also increase the memory usage and CPU load of the server. .

My answer: (D) 4 . Correct answer: (C) 3 . My answer is incorrect. While removing four links could isolate computer F from computer E, it is not the minimum number required to accomplish this. We could isolate computer F completely by only removing 3 links. . Any line between two computers represents a way for them to communicate with each other, and a communication between two computers can go through other computers. If the links from F to G, from F to A, and from F to E were broken, it would not be possible for computers E and F to communicate. . Q34 . . My answer: (C) Show that for one instance of the problem, a heuristic is needed to write an algorithm that is capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer. . Correct answer: (B) Show that for one instance of the problem, no algorithm can be written that is capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer. . This statement does not provide enough information to conclude that the problem is undecidable. This states that a heuristic is used for one instance of the problem. If it could be shown that an algorithm can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer for all other instances of this problem, then this problem would be decidable. . A decidable problem is one for which an algorithm can be constructed to produce a correct output for all inputs. If, for one instance of the problem, this is not possible, then this problem cannot be decidable. Therefore, it must be undecidable. . Q37 . . My answer: (D) The algorithm runs in an unreasonable amount of time because it will use approximately n^2 steps to draw n shapes. . Correct answer: (B) The algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time because it will use approximately n^2 steps to draw n shapes. . It is correct that as n increases, the number of steps is approximately equal to n^2. However, that means the algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time. . As n increases, the number of steps is approximately equal to n^2, which would make the algorithm polynomial. An algorithm with an efficiency that approximates n^2 is said to run in a reasonable amount of time. . Q49 . . My answer: (C) . Correct answer: (A) . This code segment traverses the list beginning with the second element, so it is correctly comparing only the student scores to the maximum possible score. However, the code segment will fail to check the last element in the list. When index is equal to the length of the list, the loop will terminate without comparing the last student score in the list to the maximum possible score. . The correct code segment traverses the list beginning with the second element, so it is correctly comparing only student scores to the maximum possible score, which is found by accessing scores[1]. The variable found will only be set to true when a student’s score equals the maximum possible score. The code also sets the number of iterations to LENGTH(scores) - 1 to reflect that the first list element (maximum score) is skipped. .",

We will be seeing the properties which can be defined within the app object.! We can see the User objects being created. The VSCode interface shows the variables for the class and how each user has their own specific values for the class blueprint. By stepping into the function, we can see what is going on during the creation of the user. We step into the function and see how the initialization of the user is done. This step is checked for the try portion and checks if the user is created. For this case, I had already created the users, so it would go into the except step. This screenshot shows the results of the schema being created. It uses the cursor object which has many function and special variables. This is the same for the connection objects. These objects are removed from the debugging interface after the code which closes them executes, showing that these objects close their connection after the code tells them to. This shows why the closing step is important, so it turns off the connection and reduces the resources needed. .",

On the latter quiz for question 4, Answer D is correct because sorting by year will sort the spreadsheet on column C from least to greatest. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Since the order of the entries is not affected by the filters, the photograph with the lowest year value will be in the first row of the spreadsheet. Answer C is incorrect because this sequence of steps does not remove any entries with an unknown year, so the entry in the first row of the spreadsheet will have a year value of -1. .",

My Answer: Neither grid I not grid II | Correct Answer: Grid I only | Explanation: In Grid I, the robot moves forward to the end of the bottom row, turns right twice, moves forward twice, turns right twice, moves forward until the end of the middle row, turns left twice, moves forward twice, turns left twice, and moves forward until Goal_Reached is true. | . Q29 . My Answer: true false true | Correct Answer: false false false | Explanation: This question was asking about a code segment and if the code segment displays a certain text. I did not understand this question very well. I put answer C which said true false true. I put this because the variables a, b, and c were defined as such. I did not understand what the code after that did so I thought it was meant just to throw me off. The correct answer is false, false, false. This is because the two code statments changed variables a and c. The a was changed to false because b was true thus not b is false. The statement then is false. The next one defines c as false because a is now defined as false making c false. If I got the correct answer on the fourth line of code I would have got it correct. | . Q31 . My Answer: Check if the time is outside business hours. If it is, check if the gate sensor is activated: If it is, check if the gate sensor is closed. If it is, turn on the motor. | Correct Answer: Check if the time is during business hours. If it is, check if the gate sensor is activated: If it is, check if the gate sensor is open. If it is, turn on the motor. | Explanation: I got this one wrong because I did not thoroughly read through the algorithm and the gate would open outside of business hours. Option D is correct because the gate would not open outside of business hours and the gate would open correctly. | . Q33 . My Answer: Repeat 3 Times | Correct Answer: Repeat 2 Times | Explanation: Here, I chose choice C when the correct answer was choice A. The code segment moves it right, forward, left, forward, and right. It does that 4 times. When I was going thru the steps in my head, it seemed correct that it would go thru 3 times. When I looked at it again just now, I saw that it would only need to repeat twice and repeating it 3 times would leave it three rows above its starting position and one row above the gray square. | . Q40 . My Answer: Interchange the rotate right and rotate left blocks | Correct Answer: No change is needed; the algorithm is correct as is | Explanation: I got this one wrong because interchanging the rotate_right and rotate_left blocks would push the robot off the grid. There would be no change needed in this algorithm. | . Q41 . My Answer: The genetic codes must be converted from binary to decimal numbers | Correct Answer: The list must be sorted based on the genetic code values | Explanation: I got this question wrong because the list has to be sorted in order of value in order to use a binary search algorithm. So, converting binary to decimal numbers is not necessary. | . Q49 . My Answer: The model used by the simulation software cannot be modified once the simulation has been used | Correct Answer: The model used by the simulation software often omits details so that it is easier to implement | Explanation: I honestly don’t know why I picked this answer. It makes no sense to be fair. A model can always be changed from a simulation stand point. Details will be omitted after the simulation is done. | . Q50 . My Answer: Algorithms A and B | Correct Answer: Algorithms A and D | Explanation: D: The number of steps for this algorithm is equal to the length of the list squared, as the number of steps is equal to n2 for a list of size n. This is an example of a polynomial efficiency and indicates that the algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time. | . B (incorrect): As the size of the list grows, the number of steps needed to sort the list grows at an exponential rate, as the number of steps is equal to 2n for a list of size n. This indicates that the algorithm does not run in a reasonable amount of time. . Final Thoughts and Blogging .

            "title": "App Lab Quiz Notes",
            "content": "Link . Here’s the link to our AppLab project: https://studio.code.org/… . Initial Thinking . Harsha and I want to build a quiz application that is user-friendly and easy to code. We want to avoid repetitive code so that we can have the most efficient programming experience. Our plan is to create an app that can support the selection of different quizzes given a dropdown selection. We want it to have 4 choices on each answer screen with only one correct answer. We also want to have a final screen which displays the score out of 3 as well as a percentage. There should be a way to go back to the main screen to retake a quiz or take the other quiz. Finally, there should be a “How to Play” screen for anyone confused about where to start. . Design Work . Harsha and I met up outside of school and did some sketches for the app on an iPad. We decided that we wanted to have a front screen with 3 images and a dropdown to select the quiz. On each question, we wanted to have a text box for the current quiz question and a 2x2 grid to display the answer choices with images and labels. We also planned out a score page that showed how many questions they got right out of 3 and percent accuracy with which they completed the quiz. The how to play screen was something Harsha designed on the fly by himself since we didn’t originally plan it but we wanted to add more features. . Creation . . Harsha and I used the JavaScript editor for quite a bit of our code. We used it to define the calculus quizzes in JavaScript objects. We used block coding to define onEvent listeners and setProperty calls because it has useful autocompletion features for the IDs of elements and their respective properties/emitters. . We designed the quiz in such a way that all the questions would live on one screen. When the user clicks the “next” or “submit” button, the following function runs” . var score = 0; var a=0; var c=0; var e=0; onEvent(&quot;hpButtonStart&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { setScreen(&quot;q1Screen&quot;); }); // q1 onEvent(&quot;q1ButtonNext&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { setScreen(&quot;q2Screen&quot;); a=getTime(); }); onEvent(&quot;q1ButtonB&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { var b=getTime(); score+=10-((b-a)/1000000000000); setText(&quot;q1Text&quot;,&quot;Your score is: &quot;+score); }); // q2 onEvent(&quot;q2ButtonNext&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { setScreen(&quot;q3Screen&quot;); c=getTime(); }); onEvent(&quot;q2ButtonC&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { var d=getTime(); score+=10-((d-c)/1000000000000); setText(&quot;q2Text&quot;,&quot;Your score is: &quot;+score); }); . This function will set the label text, image sources, and question text to the next question without having to switch screens, avoiding repeated element creation and centralizing all the quiz logic in a single function. Additionally, it reduces the amount of event listeners being created (1 for each of the total 4 images). . Program Purpose &amp; Function . A quiz to assess the user’s knowledge of calculus | Should display the user’s score at the end to show their understanding | . Data Abstraction . Definition of the a=getTime() and score variables containing objects representing the quizzes for each sport | Separated from functions that are actually using the data | . Managing Complexity . Use of a single screen to display all quiz questions using “containers” for images, the question, and the answer labels Setting certain properties on these based on the current question to show the correct information | Creation of functions to abstract away logic for changing each of these individual parts of the quiz screen | . | . Procedural Abstraction . Use of functions to update images, questions, and choices | Use of function to abstract away quiz logic and execute the correct quiz based on user | Use of function to set the current selected answer choice Changes previously selected answer label’s color, sets newly selected answer label’s color, and sets the current selected answer choice in a global variable | . | . Algorithm Implementation . Creation of a nextQuestion algorithm that procedurally fills in the correct question, labels, and answer choices for each quiz question Handles answer choice colors, text value of the “next” button (changes to “submit” for the last question) | Handles quiz ending scenario | . | . Testing . Use of console.log to debug unwanted behavior | Use of console.log to test the scoring feature Logged each correct answer, incorrect answer, and overall score) | . | .",

            "title": "Raunak Mondal What Is Art   Tolstoy For Mrs. P's Class",
            "content": "from What Is Art? by Leo Tolstoy (1897) . CHAPTER 4 EXCERPT . If we say that the aim of any activity is merely our pleasure, and define it solely by that pleasure, our definition will evidently be a false one. But this is precisely what has occurred in the efforts to define art. Now, if we consider the food question it will not occur to anyone to affirm that the importance of food consists in the pleasure we receive when eating it. Everyone understands that the satisfaction of our taste cannot serve as a basis for our definition of the merits of food, and that we have therefore no right to presuppose that the dinners with cayenne pepper, Limburg cheese, alcohol, etc., to which we are accustomed and which please us, form the very best human food. . And in the same way, beauty, or that which pleases us, can in no sense serve as the basis for the definition of art; nor can a series of objects which afford us pleasure serve as the model of what art should be. . To see the aim and purpose of art in the pleasure we get from it is like assuming (as is done by people of the lowest moral development, e.g., by savages) that the purpose and aim of food is the pleasure derived when consuming it. . —- . Just as people who conceive the aim and purpose of food to be pleasure cannot recognize the real meaning of eating, so people who consider the aim of art to be pleasure cannot realize its true meaning and purpose because they attribute to an activity the meaning of which lies in its connection with other phenomena of life, the false and exceptional aim of pleasure. People come to understand that the meaning of eating lies in the nourishment of the body only when they cease to consider that the object of that activity is pleasure. And it is the same with regard to art. People will come to understand the meaning of art only when they cease to consider that the aim of that activity is beauty, i.e., pleasure. The acknowledgment of beauty (i.e., of a certain kind of pleasure received from art) as being the aim of art not only fails to assist us in finding a definition of what art is, but, on the contrary, by transferring the question into a region quite foreign to art (into metaphysical, psychological, physiological, and even historical discussions as to why such a production pleases one person, and such another displeases or pleases someone else), it renders such definition impossible. And since discussions as to why one man likes pears and another prefers meat do not help toward finding a definition of what is essential in nourishment, so the solution of questions of taste in art (to which the discussions on art involuntarily come) not only does not help to make clear in what this particular human activity which we call art really consists, but renders such elucidation quite impossible until we rid ourselves of a conception which justifies every kind of art at the cost of confusing the whole matter. . —-- . CHAPTER 5 EXCERPT . In order correctly to define art, it is necessary, first of all, to cease to consider it as a means to pleasure and to consider it as one of the conditions of human life. Viewing it in this way we cannot fail to observe that art is one of the means of intercourse between man and man. . Every work of art causes the receiver to enter into a certain kind of relationship both with him who produced, or is producing, the art, and with all those who, simultaneously, previously, or subsequently, receive the same artistic impression. . Speech, transmitting the thoughts and experiences of men, serves as a means of union among them, and art acts in a similar manner. The peculiarity of this latter means of intercourse, distinguishing it from intercourse by means of words, consists in this, that whereas by words a man transmits his thoughts to another, by means of art he transmits his feelings. . —- . The activity of art is based on the fact that a man, receiving through his sense of hearing or sight another man&#39;s expression of feeling, is capable of experiencing the emotion which moved the man who expressed it. To take the simplest example; one man laughs, and another who hears becomes merry; or a man weeps, and another who hears feels sorrow. [...] . And it is upon this capacity of man to receive another man&#39;s expression of feeling and experience those feelings himself, that the activity of art is based. [...] . Art begins when one person, with the object of joining another or others to himself in one and the same feeling, expresses that feeling by certain external indications. To take the simplest example: a boy, having experienced, let us say, fear on encountering a wolf, relates that encounter; and, in order to evoke in others the feeling he has experienced, describes himself, his condition before the encounter, the surroundings, the woods, his own lightheartedness, and then the wolf&#39;s appearance, its movements, the distance between himself and the wolf, etc. All this, if only the boy, when telling the story, again experiences the feelings he had lived through and infects the hearers and compels them to feel what the narrator had experienced is art. If even the boy had not seen a wolf but had frequently been afraid of one, and if, wishing to evoke in others the fear he had felt, he invented an encounter with a wolf and recounted it so as to make his hearers share the feelings he experienced when he feared the world, that also would be art. And just in the same way it is art if a man, having experienced either the fear of suffering or the attraction of enjoyment (whether in reality or in imagination) expresses these feelings on canvas or in marble so that others are infected by them. And it is also art if a man feels or imagines to himself feelings of delight, gladness, sorrow, despair, courage, or despondency and the transition from one to another of these feelings, and expresses these feelings by sounds so that the hearers are infected by them and experience them as they were experienced by the composer. . —-- . The feelings with which the artist infects others may be most various - very strong or very weak, very important or very insignificant, very bad or very good: feelings of love for one&#39;s own country, self-devotion and submission to fate or to God expressed in a drama, raptures of lovers described in a novel, feelings of voluptuousness expressed in a picture, courage expressed in a triumphal march, merriment evoked by a dance, humor evoked by a funny story, the feeling of quietness transmitted by an evening landscape or by a lullaby, or the feeling of admiration evoked by a beautiful arabesque - it is all art. If only the spectators or auditors are infected by the feelings which the author has felt, it is art. . To evoke in oneself a feeling one has once experienced, and having evoked it in oneself, then, by means of movements, lines, colors, sounds, or forms expressed in words, so to transmit that feeling that others may experience the same feeling - this is the activity of art. . Art is a human activity consisting in this, that one man consciously, by means of certain external signs, hands on to others feelings he has lived through, and that other people are infected by these feelings and also experience them . —-- . CHAPTER 15 EXCERPT . Art, in our society, has been so perverted that not only has bad art come to be considered good, but even the very perception of what art really is has been lost. In order to be able to speak about the art of our society, it is, therefore, first of all necessary to distinguish art from counterfeit art. . There is one indubitable indication distinguishing real art from its counterfeit, namely, the infectiousness of art. If a man, without exercising effort and without altering his standpoint on reading, hearing, or seeing another man&#39;s work, experiences a mental condition which unites him with that man and with other people who also partake of that work of art, then the object evoking that condition is a work of art. And however poetical, realistic, effectful, or interesting a work may be, it is not a work of art if it does not evoke that feeling (quite distinct from all other feelings) of joy and of spiritual union with another (the author) and with others (those who are also infected by it). [...] . The stronger the infection, the better is the art as art, speaking now apart from its subject matter, i.e., not considering the quality of the feelings it transmits. . And the degree of the infectiousness of art depends on three conditions: . On the greater or lesser individuality of the feeling transmitted; . | on the greater or lesser clearness with which the feeling is transmitted; . | on the sincerity of the artist, i.e., on the greater or lesser force with which the artist himself feels the emotion he transmits. . | The more individual the feeling transmitted the more strongly does it act on the receiver; the more individual the state of soul into which he is transferred, the more pleasure does the receiver obtain, and therefore the more readily and strongly does he join in it. . The clearness of expression assists infection because the receiver, who mingles in consciousness with the author, is the better satisfied the more clearly the feeling is transmitted, which, as it seems to him, he has long known and felt, and for which he has only now found expression. . —- . But most of all is the degree of infectiousness of art increased by the degree of sincerity in the artist. As soon as the spectator, hearer, or reader feels that the artist is infected by his own production, and writes, sings, or plays for himself, and not merely to act on others, this mental condition of the artist infects the receiver; and contrariwise, as soon as the spectator, reader, or hearer feels that the author is not writing, singing, or playing for his own satisfaction - does not himself feel what he wishes to express - but is doing it for him, the receiver, a resistance immediately springs up, and the most individual and the newest feelings and the cleverest technique not only fail to produce any infection but actually repel. . I have mentioned three conditions of contagiousness in art, but they may be all summed up into one, the last, sincerity, i.e., that the artist should be impelled by an inner need to express his feeling. That condition includes the first; for if the artist is sincere he will express the feeling as he experienced it. And as each man is different from everyone else, his feeling will be individual for everyone else; and the more individual it is - the more the artist has drawn it from the depths of his nature - the more sympathetic and sincere will it be. And this same sincerity will impel the artist to find a clear expression of the feeling which he wishes to transmit. . Therefore this third condition - sincerity - is the most important of the three. It is always complied with in peasant art, and this explains why such art always acts so powerfully; but it is a condition almost entirely absent from our upper-class art, which is continually produced by artists actuated by personal aims of covetousness or vanity. . Such are the three conditions which divide art from its counterfeits, and which also decide the quality of every work of art apart from its subject matter. . The absence of any one of these conditions excludes a work form the category of art and relegates it to that of art&#39;s counterfeits. If the work does not transmit the artist&#39;s peculiarity of feeling and is therefore not individual, if it is unintelligibly expressed, or if it has not proceeded from the author&#39;s inner need for expression - it is not a work of art. If all these conditions are present, even in the smallest degree, then the work, even if a weak one, is yet a work of art. . | NOTES: . We cannot use our personal tastes &amp; pleasures to judge the merits of something . | . Example of food defines that . Art can’t be defined by pleasure, but should be defined by its purpose . Defining anything as that which pleases us makes defining subjective &amp; out of the arena of art . | . Art can initiate a relationship between the artist and receiver . | . The feelings of the artist are transmitted to the receiver through art, but it is up to the receiver to assess that message . | . Art is a way of expressing one’s feelings to someone else using lines, shapes, and colors . | . The intensity of the feeling that the receiver receives is always less than or equal to the intensity of the feeling that the artist sends . | . Everyone will have a different feeling due to the differences between individuals . | . Sincerity is the most important of the 3. . | . These 3 conditions differentiate an art piece from counterfeit artpieces. . | . | . MAJOR TAKEAWAYS: . Art is a method of expressing someone’s feelings to someone else . | Art is mostly “infecting” rather than “expressing” because it can spread to multiple people who can different responses to it . | Counterfeit art describes art that isn’t individual, clear, or sincere . | . READING AND DISCUSSION QUESTIONS . Why does Tolstoy believe one must understand the aim or purpose of an activity as the key to defining it? . | Tolstoy believes that the aim or purpose of an activity comes from the necessity of it, not the pleasure of it. In addition, Tolstoy believes that understanding other concepts besides aim or purpose, such as the pleasure of it, can lead to subjective beliefs that could be considered irrational or irrelevant to others. . If, as explained in the chapter 4 segment, Tolstoy believes that pleasure is not the true purpose of eating, what then is? How does this relate to art? . | The true purpose of eating is to nourish your body and provide it with the nutrients that it needs to function properly. This relates to art because the true purpose of art is not to seek the pleasure that one gains from art, but rather to sense the feelings and emotions that the artist displayed in their art. . Why does Tolstoy compare speech with art? What does each communicate? . | Speech is similar to art because in the same way speech communicates thoughts and experiences verbally using words and sentences, art communicates emotions and feelings visually using geometric shapes and colors. In addition, speech and art both serve as means of union to many people. . Why does Tolstoy describe the transmission of emotion as “infection”? How does it differ from “expression”? . | Tolstoy describes the transmission of emotion as “infection” because the emotion transmitted from art can spread to others and can stay with the individual for a long period of time. The clearness of expression assists infection because the receiver, who mingles in consciousness with the author, is the better satisfied the more clearly the feeling is transmitted, which, as it seems to him, he has long known and felt, and for which he has only now found expression. . According to Tolstoy, but in your own words, what is art? . | Art is, according to Tolstoy, a “contagious” method of expressing someone’s emotions to someone else. Art is a human activity, consisting in this, that one man consciously, by means of certain external signs, hands on to others feelings he has lived through, and that other people are infected by these feelings, and also experience them. . How is what Tolstoy is saying similar to what the authors of Cultures and Values are saying when they explain that art has a “surplus of meaning?” . | Tolstoy is saying that art can have an intensity of feeling towards the receiver greater than what is being sent out if it meets his 3 criteria (which mainly can be described as sincerity). This is similar to what the authors of Cultures and Values are saying when they explain that art has a surplus of meaning because in a similar way, more meaning is being expressed from the art than being expressed in the art. . How does Tolstoy’s ideas support, challenge or complicate (both support and challenge) your ideas about art? . | Tolstoy’s ideas supported my idea that art needed to be sincere in some way to be considered non-counterfeit art, but challenged my idea that art was more about communicating feelings and emotions rather than drawing and painting in a way that seemed aesthetically pleasing. .",

            "title": "Apwh Notes From Prehistory To Rise Of Civilizations",
            "content": "From Pre History to Civilization .   . The first humans: appear in Africa. .   . The term pre-history refers to the period when written languages and records did not yet exist. How do we know about the pre-history period? . Archeology-the study of the ways of life of early people by studying what they left behind (artifacts) . Historians-study all evidence about the past, including archeology, written documents, pictures, films, etc. .   . The Stone age . The stone age is divided into two parts. . 1) 1)      Paleolithic (Old stone age) . 2) 2)      Neolithic (New stone age) .   . During the stone age, civilization had not yet emerged. People were pre-civilized. .   . NOTE: Problems with the term “civilization” . Historians and anthropologist have noted several problems with the term civilization. First of all, it tends to be used in an ethnocentric way; in other words, it is used to assign to others an inferior status. For example, the Chinese of the Han dynasty thought all others in the world were uncivil barbarians; likewise, from the Spartans to Nazi Germany, designating others as less than civilized was often a pretense for conquering or destroying them. Secondly, the term marginalizes (excludes) other people who have made important contributions to history. For example, nomadic people are responsible for the diffusion of some of the most important technologies in history, but most accepted forms of the term civilization exclude them. .   . At its most basic element, civilization is based on the food supply. Uncivilized man lives at the mercy of the land and weather. He does not provide for times of need. .   . “Three meals a day area a highly advanced institution. Savages gorge themselves or fast.” People lived at extremes: life was either a feast or a famine. There was little thought of providing enough food for the next day. .   . Hunting and Gathering . People grubbed food from the earth with their bare hands, then used simple tools made from stones or animal bones. Thousands of generations tried countless types of plants and roots, as man learned by experience which ones could be eaten. He gathered insects, small reptiles and small animals. Large insects were dried in the sun for future meals. Man is known to have eaten shellfish, frogs, snails, mice, snakes, dogs, horses, roots, lice, insects, .   . It was nature that finally taught man to save for tomorrow. People took example from animals and insects: dogs that bury bones, squirrels that hide acorns, bees that fill the comb with honey, ants that store up food in the hill. .   . This style of living is called Paleolithic. Its characteristics are: . 1) 1)      limited population group . 2) 2)      no permanent settlements . 3) 3)      social equality . 1. a.       no gender divisions: men and women both committed to search for food 2. b.      no separation of people according to occupation or trade. No hierarchies or social classes as we know of them today. .   . Paleolithic people have left us works of art that depict their lives. These are mainly paintings on the walls of caves. These served religious purposes; they were ways to bring good luck or the blessings of the gods on an up and coming hunt. .   . The change from Paleolithic to Neolithic societies . 1) From hunting to domestication of animals. . Instead of hunting, people learned to keep animals in a pen or pasture. Domestication: to tame something, to take it from the wild to live under the care of humans. Probably started when wounded animals were brought back to camp. It brought a more stable food source .   . 2) From gathering to agriculture . Perhaps the greatest discovery in the course of human history was the discovery of the function of the seed. Every plant has the ability to reproduce. This was probably discovered when some stray gathered seeds grew identical plants. Many historians believe women discovered the reproductive nature of seeds. .   . The Neolithic Revolution . The ability to acquire food on a regular basis drastically changed life: there was more stability and order. Life developed according to special patterns; they had to follow seasons. Religion worshipped reproduction and fertility. Aspects of nomadic life were given up. .   . Food production increase as people learned new ways of producing and storing more food. A surplus of food emerged. Surplus=having more than one needs, extra. .   . Results: . 1) This freed some people from having to spend all their time producing food. They could learn other skills. Artisans made weapons and jewelry. Specialty products could be made that were not available to nomadic people. .   . 2) Surplus of food could be sold or traded with other communities. Neolithic communities came in contact with other communities around them. .   .   .   . Changes of Neolithic Revolution: (Try to categorize these as social, economic, and demographic changes.) .   . 1) Probably the most significant change that took place with the Neolithic revolution was a dramatic increase in population. More food could sustain more people living together. . 2)  people needed to build permanent houses for protection and storing food .   . 3) People began to specialize in certain crafts, social divisions began, laborers/merchants . 4) Gender roles changed. Hunters and gatherers assigned similar roles to men and women. In the Neolithic revolution, the work that produced food became relegated to men, and household chores became the women’s job. Men came to be the dominant gender in society. .   . The Bronze Age . During this age people discovered how to use metals instead of stone. The use of metals (copper + tin = bronze) brought the Neolithic period to an end, although many of the skills learned during that time would continue .   .   . NOTE: The use of metals in early history . We call prehistory the Stone Age because most tools were made from stone. Slowly, early man learned to use copper from the ground. The problem with copper is that it is soft and easily bends; it will not keep a sharp edge. At some point, man learned to mix melted copper with melted tin to produce bronze. This technology (a learned technique or skill) produced a metal that was much more useful than copper or tin alone. Bronze could keep a sharp edge. But it was a technology that had to be learned. .   . The problem with bronze was that it was very brittle and would easily break upon contact with armor, bones or rocks. Soon, man learned to make a superior metal: iron. The production of this metal was more complex than that of bronze. Whereas bronze could be produced on an open fire, such fires were not hot enough to produce iron. Man learned to dramatically increase the temperature of fires by blasting air into the coals. This fed the fire more oxygen than it would get from a normal burn. With such fires, iron could be forged. .   . Weapons made from iron stayed sharp and easily shattered bronze weapons. Armies with iron weapons had a significant advantage over armies using stone or other metals. Because its production required additional technological skills, iron-making skills were kept secret by the Hittites who first learned how to make it. .   .   . Bronze was a hard, durable metal. It made better tools. . 1) Farming: food production drastically increased. This meant that people did not have to move around. They could stay in one place and build permanent homes. Once the problem of the food supply was solved, people could also group together in larger numbers and build cities. This is called urbanization. . 4) 4)      Weapons: Because people grouped together in larger numbers, more security was needed. Cities needed walls and large armies for protection. . 5) 5)      Government: all these changes made it necessary to provide more organization. Questions of “who is in control and will make the final decisions?” had to be answered. Kings emerged. .   . In short, The Bronze Age led directly to the birth of a new form of human organization: Civilization. .   . Civilization . The study of history begins with civilization. This is because civilized man has the ability to write things down, and these written records provide historians with clues about their lives. There are several things that make up civilizations: . 1) cities . 2) governments . 3) religion . 4) social distinctions . 5) artistic expression .   . The first civilizations in the world emerged in river valleys in China, India, Africa, and the Middle East. Here is a brief comparison of the river valley civilizations in Africa and the Middle East. .   . The River Valley Civilizations .   . A surplus of agricultural production led to the rise of complex human societies, or civilizations. With the need of agricultural societies to irrigate, it is not surprising that many civilizations emerged in river valleys. The River Valley civilizations that emerged on the Yellow River (China), the Indus River (India), the Nile River (Egypt), and between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers (Mesopotamia) made lasting contributions to civilizations. The following chart compares the important features of a few of these river valley civilizations. As you look over this, attempt to piece together what these civilizations have in common and what differentiates them. .   .   .         .   | Egypt | Mesopotamia | Shang | . Geography | Egypt was protected by natural barriers on all sides. The Nile provided the perfect waterway for trade. Also, the Nile flooded each year at about the same time, a fact that gave them a distinct sense of each year’s passing (they created the calendar to predict this). It also naturally fertilized the land and provided for abundant agriculture. Many people attribute the Egyptians’ optimism (eternal life) on the good fortune of its geography. | The Tigris and Euphrates Rivers flooded randomly and violently without much warning, a condition that probably contributed to their pessimistic view of the gods and fatalistic view of life. Also, Mesopotamia had no natural barriers protecting them from enemy neighbors. They were subject to constant invasion. The rivers facilitated trade and allowed some of the cities to grow quite wealthy. | China is geographically isolated. Although the Shang traded with other civilizations, their limited contact with others produced an ethnocentric outlook. They called their land the Middle Kingdom, an assertion that implied that other people were on the periphery of the civilized world. Their land was fertile and supported a surplus of agriculture without complex irrigations systems. | . Political | Egypt was united under one central government. Egyptians believed the king, or Pharaoh, was a god. This helped keep order because people were more inclined to obey the king if he was a god. Religious myths reinforced this belief. The government was strictly centralized and controlled the resources of the state. | Mesopotamian civilization was made up of many independent city-states that never were able to unit. This made them weak and vulnerable to invasion. However, sometimes the people had to unite to build irrigation canals for their agriculture. They developed written laws, the Code of Hammurabi, which was probably made to give unity to an expanding empire. | Most rule was local, consisting of a network of walled towns whose leaders were loyal to the king. These local leaders comprised the bureaucracy, a group of aristocratic chieftains who could be removed at the kings will. | . Society and Economics | Women had more rights than in most early civilizations. There were certain jobs, however, that women were not allowed to do. The most people in Egypt worked in agriculture. The Nile allowed Egyptians to trade with other civilizations and were in turn influenced by them. | The Code Of Hammurabi reinforced patriarchy and social distinctions. A business class of people operated quite independent of government control. Like in Egypt, most people in Mesopotamia were farmers. Certain cities traded and grew rich. We know they traded with Egypt and India. | The family was the most important social institution. Men had most all of the authority. As villages became more productive, social classes became more distinct. | . Religion | The Egyptians were polytheistic. The lineage of the gods extended to the pharaoh himself who had absolute power and was revered as a god. | The Mesopotamians were polytheistic. Each city-state had its own set of god that it worshipped along with a set of wider known gods. They built monuments called ziggurats to their gods. Their gods were often different manifestations of nature and were invoked to help in good harvests. Interestingly, the Sumerians viewed their gods as disinterested in human beings, probably a result of their unfortunate geographical allotment. | The honor and respect given to family elders was related to the worship of ancestors. Dead ancestors were summoned for advice through oracle bones and other means. Thus religion both drew from and reinforced patriarchy. | .   .   . Additional Notes: . The civilization in Mesopotamia, like that in China and Central America, is a rare example of a civilization that developed from scratch with no precedents to borrow from anyone else. | .   . The River Valley civilizations came up with many things we take for granted such as calendars, the wheel, alphabets, bureaucracies, divisions of time into units of 60, and complex mathematical concepts like square roots. | .   . Not all early complex civilizations had written languages (the civilizations of the Incas, for example.) | .   . Civilizations acquire new practices either through cultural diffusion (the Assyrians learned iron technology from the Hittites) or through independent invention (the Chinese bureaucracy). It is a good idea to know some more examples of these two ways. | .",

Gravitational Potential Energy in a constant gravitational field is: Ug = mgh . | . h is the “vertical height above the horizontal zero line” and you have to always identify the horizontal zero line. . If you prefer the equation from the AP sheet, it is: ΔUg = mgΔh . The AP equation is the “change in” gravitational potential energy. . | . | | Energy can be neither created nor destroyed, so in a non-isolated system the change in energy of the system equals the sum of the energy transferred to or from the system: ΔEsystem = ∑T . If the system is isolated, no energy is transferred into or out of the system: ΔEsystem = 0 . The change in energy of the system is the change in mechanical energy of the system plus the change in internal energy of the system. ΔME + ΔEinternal = 0 . | The change in internal energy of the system is done by nonconservative forces or friction. In other words, the energy which is dissipated by friction goes into the system as internal energy. ΔEinternal = −Wnc . A nonconservative force is a force where the work done by the force is dependent on the path taken by the object. Conservative forces are where the work done by the force is not dependent on the path taken by the object. . | . | In other words: ΔME −Wnc = 0 ⇒Wnc = ΔME and because I don’t know of any forces which are nonconservative which are not friction: . | Wfriction = ΔME (is only true when there is no energy transferred into our out of . | . | | . the system.) . If the system is isolated and there is no work done by friction: . Wfriction = ΔME ⇒ 0 = ΔME = MEf − MEi ⇒ MEi = MEf . | We have conservation of mechanical energy. . | Which is only true when the system is isolated and no work is done by friction. . | . | Whenever you use Wfriction = ΔME or MEi = MEf you have to identify the initial point, the final point and the horizontal zero line. . | All forms of Mechanical Energy are in terms of joules, just like Work. . | . • Power is the rate at which work is done: P | = | W | | &amp; P | = | dW | | | | | | | | . | | Δt | | | | dt | | | | | | | | . | | | | | | average . | | | | instantaneous | | | | . | dW | | d . | ! | ! | | ! . | | ! ! | | | | | . | | | | | | | dΔr | | | | | | | . o Pinstantaneous = . | | = | | (F i Δr | ) = F i . | | | = F i v | | | | | | . | dt | | dt . | | | dt | | | | | | | | .

A subscript is missing: Fg = mog where “o” stands for “object”. . | o All forces require two objects. This equation is the force of gravitational attraction which exists between the object and a planet. . § For us, the planet usually is the Earth. gEarth = 9.81 sm2 . • Any two objects which have mass have a force of gravitational attraction between them. This force is determined using Newton’s Universal Law of Gravitation. (The Big G Equation) . o Fg = | Gm1m2 | : G is the Universal Gravitational Constant. G = 6.67 ×10 . | −11 N ⋅ m2 | | | . | r2 | | | kg2 . | | . Requires two objects: mass 1 and mass 2. . | r is not the radius by definition. r is the distance between the centers of mass of the two objects. Yes, sometimes r is the radius. . | This equation is the magnitude of the force of gravitational attraction. The force is always directed toward the other object. . | . Thank you to one of my Quality Control team members, Frank Geshwind, for pointing out . | ! | = − . | Gm1m2 | ˆ . | | . that I should have talked about the vector form of this equation: Fg | | r2 | r12 . | | . § Note: rˆ12 is the unit vector from object 1 to object 2. | | | | | . | | ! . | = − . | Gm1m2 | ! . | | . § Some textbooks even use this equation: Fg | | r3 | r12 . | | | | . | ! | | | | | | . • . | Note the subtle change here. r12 | is no longer the unit vector and . | | | | | . therefore the cube of r needs to be in the denominator. J . • Setting the two equations for the Force of Gravity acting on an object on the surface of the Earth equal to one another yields this: . o | Fg . | = Fg . | ⇒ mog = . | Gmo mE | ⇒ gEarth = . | | GmE . | | | . | | | | 2 | | (REarth | + Altitude) . | 2 | | . | | | | r | | | | | | . | | | | | | | | | | . As long as REarth ≫ ΔAltitude the gEarth ≈ constant . . | . In other words, close to the surface of the planet, the acceleration due to gravity can be considered to be constant. We live in a constant gravitational field. . | The gravitational potential energy is then constant: Ug = mgh . | 0203 Lecture Notes - AP Physics C- Universal Gravitation Review (Mechanics).docx page 1 of 3 . When viewed from a frame of reference which is not on the surface of the planet, the acceleration due to gravity is not constant and we need a different equation: . | . o Universal Gravitational Potential Energy: Ug = − Gm1m2 . . r . This equation assumes a zero line which is infinitely far away. ( r ≈ ∞ ) . | This means Universal Gravitational Potential Energy can never be positive. . | This equation requires two objects. . | . § Note: This equation is not Fg = | Gm1m2 | r is not squared. . | | . | r2 | | | . The gravitational potential energy which exists between an object and the Earth in terms of the objects distance, r, from the center of the Earth looks like this: . | . . Assumes constant density Earth. (Which is not true, however, we often assume it is.) o Be aware the graph as shown above left has an incorrect part: . This cannot be correct because this implies an object would experience a change in gravitational potential energy of zero. . ΔUg = Uf − Ui = 0 − 0 = 0 (This makes no sense.) . | . | This implies it takes zero energy to move an object from the center of a planet to infinitely far from the planet. . WFa = ΔME = ΔUg = 0 (Again, this makes no sense.) . | . | This would mean the planet has a binding energy of zero; still makes no sense. . | I will be releasing a video with the correct solution soon. . | . | The Gravitational Potential Energy which exists between the two objects when the object . | is on the surface of the Earth is: Ug | = − . | Gmo mE | | . | | RE | | . | | | | . • What is the minimum amount of work necessary to completely remove an object from a planet if the object is resting on the surface of the planet? This is called the Binding Energy. Assume the object is moved infinitely far away, has zero velocity when it gets there, and there is no friction. .

Kepler’s 3 laws. I find having a basic understanding of the his first two laws is adequate, however, you need to know how to derive Kepler’s 3rd law. . | Kepler’s 1st Law is that orbits are elliptical and defined as such: . | . . Two foci at F1 and F2. . Each focus is located a distance c from the center of the ellipse. o Semimajor axis of length a. (Major axis of length 2a) . | | o Semiminor axis of length b. (Minor axis of length 2b) o r1 + r2 = 2a . o a2 = b2 + c2 . o Eccentricity of an ellipse is defined as c/a. For a circle c = 0 therefore eccentricity = 0. o The eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit is 0.017, which means its orbit is nearly circular. . Kepler’s 2nd Law states that a line between the sun and the planet sweeps out an equal area over an equal time interval. . The result of this is that the closer an object is to the planet during an orbit, the faster its orbital speed will be. . | | . Let’s derive Kepler’s 3rd law: We assume circular orbit. The only force acting on the orbital object is the force of gravity acting inward.

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
