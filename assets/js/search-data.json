            "title": "Exploring the Bengali Community in America",
            "content": "Exploring the Bengali Community in America . As a Bengali American who’s deeply interested in analyzing sociopolitical data, I’ve always been fascinated about analyzing the many different facets of the Bengali community and how we’ve settled in America. However, I wasn’t able to find much data about the Bengali community in America until very recently. I mostly think that the lack of the data about the Bengali community in America is mostly due to how small it is. According to Wikipedia, there are 375,143 Bengali Americans, making up 0.12% of the entire American population, and given that the Bengali community in America is mostly split between Bangladeshi Americans and Indian Bengali Americans, there isn’t that much coverage given to the Bengali American community compared to other Asian American ethnicities or even South Asian American ethnicites. I was looking at the Demographic Statistical Atlas and was bored enough to find that it has readily accessible data for languages (specifically the number of people who speak them and how many of them are speak English “very well”) by congressional district. I was a bit disappointed that I wasn’t able to get that same level of readily accessable data by county instead, but since congressional district data tends to be more granular than county data in most urban areas, and given that most Bengalis in America live in urban areas, it didn’t feel that underwhelming to find the data. I inputted the data into the Google Sheet linked here. . One of the first pieces of data that I wanted to measure was the percentage of Bengali Americans in a given congressional district that are of Indian Bengali origin. This is because as a Indian Bengali American living in San Diego, California, I have travelled to many East Coast cities such as Boston, New York City, and Atlanta and have noticed that the Bengali community there is mostly Bangladeshi, almost to the point where Bengali is synonymous for Bangladeshi. I measured the percentage of Bengali Americans in a given congressional district that are of Indian Bengali origin by subtracting the Bangladeshi population of a given congressional district off from the total population of Bengali speakers in that district, dividing that by the total number of Bengali speakers in that district and multiplying it by 100%. I assumed that the number of Bengali speakers and people of Bengali descent would be the same for each district because the vast majority of Bengali Americans are either immigrants or the children of immigrants, as mass immigration from Bengal to America didn’t start until the late 1980s. One of the first interesting datapoints that I got was that in my congressional district, CA-52, the majority of Bengali Americans (70%) were of Indian Bengali descent. As someone who has known the Bengali American community of San Diego (especially North San Diego, the majority of which is represented in CA-52) for a long time, I have experienced that the local Bengali community is mostly Indian Bengali rather than of Bangladeshi origin. However, many of the Bengali families I know that have immigrated from India are actually Bangladeshi Hindu families that immigrated to India following the Partition of India in 1947 (and then immigrated to America some time after that). However, most families that have such origin don’t identify as Bangladeshi due to them not having been in the country of Bangladesh for more than half a century. On the other hand, in congressional district CA-34, which spans downtown Los Angeles (including Little Bangladesh), the percentage of Bengalis that are of Indian origin drops down to 45%, which makes sense due to the presence of Little Bangladesh in the district. However, the percentage of Bengalis that are of Indian origin is higher in the wealthier and more suburban congressional districts near LA, such as CA-33 and CA-45, which reflects Indian Bengalis tending to take more white-collar jobs and Bangladeshis tending to take more blue-collar jobs (I’ll expand more on that in this post). This pattern holds true in the Bay Area as well; more than 80% of the Bengalis in congressional districts CA-15, CA-17, and CA-18 are of Indian origin, which goes with my anecdotal experiences in the Bay Area as Bengali is almost synonymous with “Indian Bengali”, which is the complete opposite of my experience on the East Coast. However, this pattern doesn’t hold exactly true in Texas; while richer districts within metropolitan areas tend to have more Indian Bengalis, the differences between metropolitan areas are greater than the differences within metropolitan areas. This pattern is reflected in the cultural practices of Bengalis in such metropolitan areas; while there are plenty of Bangladeshi businesses in the Dallas metropolitan area (especially in Irving), there are more Indian Bengali businesses in Houston, and there is even a Hindu temple in Houston mostly used by Bengali Hindus (the Houston Durgabari Society). For example, the poorest congressional district in Houston with a significant Bengali population, TX-09, has a Bengali population that is more Indian Bengali than that of the richest district in Dallas with a significant Bengali population, TX-03. However, the pattern holds true in Detroit, Atlanta, and Philadelphia. In Chicago and in the DC metropolitan area, the pattern tends to be obfuscated by other geographic factors. For example, in Chicago, the western suburbs tend to have more Bangladeshi communities than the more urban eastern congressional districts, which tend to have more Indian Bengalis. Similarly, in the DC metropolitan area, Northern Virginia tends to have more Bangladeshis than Indian Bengalis, while the Maryland districts tend to have more Indian Bengalis than Bangladeshis. Much of these geographic factors might boil down to airport routes: there might be more airport routes from O’Hare, Dulles, and DFW to airports in Bangladesh (specifically Dhaka), given that all 3 airports have more international destinations than other such nearby airports. This might also explain why the Bangladeshi community in America tends to hail more from the region immediately surrounding Dhaka rather than more distant regions such as Sylhet, which are more represented in the Bangladeshi diaspora in the United Kingdo. However, this factor doesn’t explain the more seemingly haphazard nature of the distribution of the Bengali community in the New York metropolitan area, which I’ll discuss in great detail in the next paragraph. . The Bengali community of the New York metropolitan area doesn’t completely follow the patterns exhibited in other metropolitan areas. While richer congressional districts tend to have Bengali communities that are more Indian Bengali than Bangladeshi, one of the richest congressional districts in the New York metropolitan area, NY-12, has a Bengali community that is 88% Bangladeshi. This can be explained by historical factors though: .",

            "title": "Raunak Mondal What Is Art   Tolstoy For Mrs. P's Class",
            "content": "from What Is Art? by Leo Tolstoy (1897) . CHAPTER 4 EXCERPT . If we say that the aim of any activity is merely our pleasure, and define it solely by that pleasure, our definition will evidently be a false one. But this is precisely what has occurred in the efforts to define art. Now, if we consider the food question it will not occur to anyone to affirm that the importance of food consists in the pleasure we receive when eating it. Everyone understands that the satisfaction of our taste cannot serve as a basis for our definition of the merits of food, and that we have therefore no right to presuppose that the dinners with cayenne pepper, Limburg cheese, alcohol, etc., to which we are accustomed and which please us, form the very best human food. . And in the same way, beauty, or that which pleases us, can in no sense serve as the basis for the definition of art; nor can a series of objects which afford us pleasure serve as the model of what art should be. . To see the aim and purpose of art in the pleasure we get from it is like assuming (as is done by people of the lowest moral development, e.g., by savages) that the purpose and aim of food is the pleasure derived when consuming it. . —- . Just as people who conceive the aim and purpose of food to be pleasure cannot recognize the real meaning of eating, so people who consider the aim of art to be pleasure cannot realize its true meaning and purpose because they attribute to an activity the meaning of which lies in its connection with other phenomena of life, the false and exceptional aim of pleasure. People come to understand that the meaning of eating lies in the nourishment of the body only when they cease to consider that the object of that activity is pleasure. And it is the same with regard to art. People will come to understand the meaning of art only when they cease to consider that the aim of that activity is beauty, i.e., pleasure. The acknowledgment of beauty (i.e., of a certain kind of pleasure received from art) as being the aim of art not only fails to assist us in finding a definition of what art is, but, on the contrary, by transferring the question into a region quite foreign to art (into metaphysical, psychological, physiological, and even historical discussions as to why such a production pleases one person, and such another displeases or pleases someone else), it renders such definition impossible. And since discussions as to why one man likes pears and another prefers meat do not help toward finding a definition of what is essential in nourishment, so the solution of questions of taste in art (to which the discussions on art involuntarily come) not only does not help to make clear in what this particular human activity which we call art really consists, but renders such elucidation quite impossible until we rid ourselves of a conception which justifies every kind of art at the cost of confusing the whole matter. . —-- . CHAPTER 5 EXCERPT . In order correctly to define art, it is necessary, first of all, to cease to consider it as a means to pleasure and to consider it as one of the conditions of human life. Viewing it in this way we cannot fail to observe that art is one of the means of intercourse between man and man. . Every work of art causes the receiver to enter into a certain kind of relationship both with him who produced, or is producing, the art, and with all those who, simultaneously, previously, or subsequently, receive the same artistic impression. . Speech, transmitting the thoughts and experiences of men, serves as a means of union among them, and art acts in a similar manner. The peculiarity of this latter means of intercourse, distinguishing it from intercourse by means of words, consists in this, that whereas by words a man transmits his thoughts to another, by means of art he transmits his feelings. . —- . The activity of art is based on the fact that a man, receiving through his sense of hearing or sight another man&#39;s expression of feeling, is capable of experiencing the emotion which moved the man who expressed it. To take the simplest example; one man laughs, and another who hears becomes merry; or a man weeps, and another who hears feels sorrow. [...] . And it is upon this capacity of man to receive another man&#39;s expression of feeling and experience those feelings himself, that the activity of art is based. [...] . Art begins when one person, with the object of joining another or others to himself in one and the same feeling, expresses that feeling by certain external indications. To take the simplest example: a boy, having experienced, let us say, fear on encountering a wolf, relates that encounter; and, in order to evoke in others the feeling he has experienced, describes himself, his condition before the encounter, the surroundings, the woods, his own lightheartedness, and then the wolf&#39;s appearance, its movements, the distance between himself and the wolf, etc. All this, if only the boy, when telling the story, again experiences the feelings he had lived through and infects the hearers and compels them to feel what the narrator had experienced is art. If even the boy had not seen a wolf but had frequently been afraid of one, and if, wishing to evoke in others the fear he had felt, he invented an encounter with a wolf and recounted it so as to make his hearers share the feelings he experienced when he feared the world, that also would be art. And just in the same way it is art if a man, having experienced either the fear of suffering or the attraction of enjoyment (whether in reality or in imagination) expresses these feelings on canvas or in marble so that others are infected by them. And it is also art if a man feels or imagines to himself feelings of delight, gladness, sorrow, despair, courage, or despondency and the transition from one to another of these feelings, and expresses these feelings by sounds so that the hearers are infected by them and experience them as they were experienced by the composer. . —-- . The feelings with which the artist infects others may be most various - very strong or very weak, very important or very insignificant, very bad or very good: feelings of love for one&#39;s own country, self-devotion and submission to fate or to God expressed in a drama, raptures of lovers described in a novel, feelings of voluptuousness expressed in a picture, courage expressed in a triumphal march, merriment evoked by a dance, humor evoked by a funny story, the feeling of quietness transmitted by an evening landscape or by a lullaby, or the feeling of admiration evoked by a beautiful arabesque - it is all art. If only the spectators or auditors are infected by the feelings which the author has felt, it is art. . To evoke in oneself a feeling one has once experienced, and having evoked it in oneself, then, by means of movements, lines, colors, sounds, or forms expressed in words, so to transmit that feeling that others may experience the same feeling - this is the activity of art. . Art is a human activity consisting in this, that one man consciously, by means of certain external signs, hands on to others feelings he has lived through, and that other people are infected by these feelings and also experience them . —-- . CHAPTER 15 EXCERPT . Art, in our society, has been so perverted that not only has bad art come to be considered good, but even the very perception of what art really is has been lost. In order to be able to speak about the art of our society, it is, therefore, first of all necessary to distinguish art from counterfeit art. . There is one indubitable indication distinguishing real art from its counterfeit, namely, the infectiousness of art. If a man, without exercising effort and without altering his standpoint on reading, hearing, or seeing another man&#39;s work, experiences a mental condition which unites him with that man and with other people who also partake of that work of art, then the object evoking that condition is a work of art. And however poetical, realistic, effectful, or interesting a work may be, it is not a work of art if it does not evoke that feeling (quite distinct from all other feelings) of joy and of spiritual union with another (the author) and with others (those who are also infected by it). [...] . The stronger the infection, the better is the art as art, speaking now apart from its subject matter, i.e., not considering the quality of the feelings it transmits. . And the degree of the infectiousness of art depends on three conditions: . On the greater or lesser individuality of the feeling transmitted; . | on the greater or lesser clearness with which the feeling is transmitted; . | on the sincerity of the artist, i.e., on the greater or lesser force with which the artist himself feels the emotion he transmits. . | The more individual the feeling transmitted the more strongly does it act on the receiver; the more individual the state of soul into which he is transferred, the more pleasure does the receiver obtain, and therefore the more readily and strongly does he join in it. . The clearness of expression assists infection because the receiver, who mingles in consciousness with the author, is the better satisfied the more clearly the feeling is transmitted, which, as it seems to him, he has long known and felt, and for which he has only now found expression. . —- . But most of all is the degree of infectiousness of art increased by the degree of sincerity in the artist. As soon as the spectator, hearer, or reader feels that the artist is infected by his own production, and writes, sings, or plays for himself, and not merely to act on others, this mental condition of the artist infects the receiver; and contrariwise, as soon as the spectator, reader, or hearer feels that the author is not writing, singing, or playing for his own satisfaction - does not himself feel what he wishes to express - but is doing it for him, the receiver, a resistance immediately springs up, and the most individual and the newest feelings and the cleverest technique not only fail to produce any infection but actually repel. . I have mentioned three conditions of contagiousness in art, but they may be all summed up into one, the last, sincerity, i.e., that the artist should be impelled by an inner need to express his feeling. That condition includes the first; for if the artist is sincere he will express the feeling as he experienced it. And as each man is different from everyone else, his feeling will be individual for everyone else; and the more individual it is - the more the artist has drawn it from the depths of his nature - the more sympathetic and sincere will it be. And this same sincerity will impel the artist to find a clear expression of the feeling which he wishes to transmit. . Therefore this third condition - sincerity - is the most important of the three. It is always complied with in peasant art, and this explains why such art always acts so powerfully; but it is a condition almost entirely absent from our upper-class art, which is continually produced by artists actuated by personal aims of covetousness or vanity. . Such are the three conditions which divide art from its counterfeits, and which also decide the quality of every work of art apart from its subject matter. . The absence of any one of these conditions excludes a work form the category of art and relegates it to that of art&#39;s counterfeits. If the work does not transmit the artist&#39;s peculiarity of feeling and is therefore not individual, if it is unintelligibly expressed, or if it has not proceeded from the author&#39;s inner need for expression - it is not a work of art. If all these conditions are present, even in the smallest degree, then the work, even if a weak one, is yet a work of art. . | NOTES: . We cannot use our personal tastes &amp; pleasures to judge the merits of something . | . Example of food defines that . Art can’t be defined by pleasure, but should be defined by its purpose . Defining anything as that which pleases us makes defining subjective &amp; out of the arena of art . | . Art can initiate a relationship between the artist and receiver . | . The feelings of the artist are transmitted to the receiver through art, but it is up to the receiver to assess that message . | . Art is a way of expressing one’s feelings to someone else using lines, shapes, and colors . | . The intensity of the feeling that the receiver receives is always less than or equal to the intensity of the feeling that the artist sends . | . Everyone will have a different feeling due to the differences between individuals . | . Sincerity is the most important of the 3. . | . These 3 conditions differentiate an art piece from counterfeit artpieces. . | . | . MAJOR TAKEAWAYS: . Art is a method of expressing someone’s feelings to someone else . | Art is mostly “infecting” rather than “expressing” because it can spread to multiple people who can different responses to it . | Counterfeit art describes art that isn’t individual, clear, or sincere . | . READING AND DISCUSSION QUESTIONS . Why does Tolstoy believe one must understand the aim or purpose of an activity as the key to defining it? . | Tolstoy believes that the aim or purpose of an activity comes from the necessity of it, not the pleasure of it. In addition, Tolstoy believes that understanding other concepts besides aim or purpose, such as the pleasure of it, can lead to subjective beliefs that could be considered irrational or irrelevant to others. . If, as explained in the chapter 4 segment, Tolstoy believes that pleasure is not the true purpose of eating, what then is? How does this relate to art? . | The true purpose of eating is to nourish your body and provide it with the nutrients that it needs to function properly. This relates to art because the true purpose of art is not to seek the pleasure that one gains from art, but rather to sense the feelings and emotions that the artist displayed in their art. . Why does Tolstoy compare speech with art? What does each communicate? . | Speech is similar to art because in the same way speech communicates thoughts and experiences verbally using words and sentences, art communicates emotions and feelings visually using geometric shapes and colors. In addition, speech and art both serve as means of union to many people. . Why does Tolstoy describe the transmission of emotion as “infection”? How does it differ from “expression”? . | Tolstoy describes the transmission of emotion as “infection” because the emotion transmitted from art can spread to others and can stay with the individual for a long period of time. The clearness of expression assists infection because the receiver, who mingles in consciousness with the author, is the better satisfied the more clearly the feeling is transmitted, which, as it seems to him, he has long known and felt, and for which he has only now found expression. . According to Tolstoy, but in your own words, what is art? . | Art is, according to Tolstoy, a “contagious” method of expressing someone’s emotions to someone else. Art is a human activity, consisting in this, that one man consciously, by means of certain external signs, hands on to others feelings he has lived through, and that other people are infected by these feelings, and also experience them. . How is what Tolstoy is saying similar to what the authors of Cultures and Values are saying when they explain that art has a “surplus of meaning?” . | Tolstoy is saying that art can have an intensity of feeling towards the receiver greater than what is being sent out if it meets his 3 criteria (which mainly can be described as sincerity). This is similar to what the authors of Cultures and Values are saying when they explain that art has a surplus of meaning because in a similar way, more meaning is being expressed from the art than being expressed in the art. . How does Tolstoy’s ideas support, challenge or complicate (both support and challenge) your ideas about art? . | Tolstoy’s ideas supported my idea that art needed to be sincere in some way to be considered non-counterfeit art, but challenged my idea that art was more about communicating feelings and emotions rather than drawing and painting in a way that seemed aesthetically pleasing. .",

            "title": "Apwh Notes From Prehistory To Rise Of Civilizations",
            "content": "From Pre History to Civilization .   . The first humans: appear in Africa. .   . The term pre-history refers to the period when written languages and records did not yet exist. How do we know about the pre-history period? . Archeology-the study of the ways of life of early people by studying what they left behind (artifacts) . Historians-study all evidence about the past, including archeology, written documents, pictures, films, etc. .   . The Stone age . The stone age is divided into two parts. . 1) 1)      Paleolithic (Old stone age) . 2) 2)      Neolithic (New stone age) .   . During the stone age, civilization had not yet emerged. People were pre-civilized. .   . NOTE: Problems with the term “civilization” . Historians and anthropologist have noted several problems with the term civilization. First of all, it tends to be used in an ethnocentric way; in other words, it is used to assign to others an inferior status. For example, the Chinese of the Han dynasty thought all others in the world were uncivil barbarians; likewise, from the Spartans to Nazi Germany, designating others as less than civilized was often a pretense for conquering or destroying them. Secondly, the term marginalizes (excludes) other people who have made important contributions to history. For example, nomadic people are responsible for the diffusion of some of the most important technologies in history, but most accepted forms of the term civilization exclude them. .   . At its most basic element, civilization is based on the food supply. Uncivilized man lives at the mercy of the land and weather. He does not provide for times of need. .   . “Three meals a day area a highly advanced institution. Savages gorge themselves or fast.” People lived at extremes: life was either a feast or a famine. There was little thought of providing enough food for the next day. .   . Hunting and Gathering . People grubbed food from the earth with their bare hands, then used simple tools made from stones or animal bones. Thousands of generations tried countless types of plants and roots, as man learned by experience which ones could be eaten. He gathered insects, small reptiles and small animals. Large insects were dried in the sun for future meals. Man is known to have eaten shellfish, frogs, snails, mice, snakes, dogs, horses, roots, lice, insects, .   . It was nature that finally taught man to save for tomorrow. People took example from animals and insects: dogs that bury bones, squirrels that hide acorns, bees that fill the comb with honey, ants that store up food in the hill. .   . This style of living is called Paleolithic. Its characteristics are: . 1) 1)      limited population group . 2) 2)      no permanent settlements . 3) 3)      social equality . 1. a.       no gender divisions: men and women both committed to search for food 2. b.      no separation of people according to occupation or trade. No hierarchies or social classes as we know of them today. .   . Paleolithic people have left us works of art that depict their lives. These are mainly paintings on the walls of caves. These served religious purposes; they were ways to bring good luck or the blessings of the gods on an up and coming hunt. .   . The change from Paleolithic to Neolithic societies . 1) From hunting to domestication of animals. . Instead of hunting, people learned to keep animals in a pen or pasture. Domestication: to tame something, to take it from the wild to live under the care of humans. Probably started when wounded animals were brought back to camp. It brought a more stable food source .   . 2) From gathering to agriculture . Perhaps the greatest discovery in the course of human history was the discovery of the function of the seed. Every plant has the ability to reproduce. This was probably discovered when some stray gathered seeds grew identical plants. Many historians believe women discovered the reproductive nature of seeds. .   . The Neolithic Revolution . The ability to acquire food on a regular basis drastically changed life: there was more stability and order. Life developed according to special patterns; they had to follow seasons. Religion worshipped reproduction and fertility. Aspects of nomadic life were given up. .   . Food production increase as people learned new ways of producing and storing more food. A surplus of food emerged. Surplus=having more than one needs, extra. .   . Results: . 1) This freed some people from having to spend all their time producing food. They could learn other skills. Artisans made weapons and jewelry. Specialty products could be made that were not available to nomadic people. .   . 2) Surplus of food could be sold or traded with other communities. Neolithic communities came in contact with other communities around them. .   .   .   . Changes of Neolithic Revolution: (Try to categorize these as social, economic, and demographic changes.) .   . 1) Probably the most significant change that took place with the Neolithic revolution was a dramatic increase in population. More food could sustain more people living together. . 2)  people needed to build permanent houses for protection and storing food .   . 3) People began to specialize in certain crafts, social divisions began, laborers/merchants . 4) Gender roles changed. Hunters and gatherers assigned similar roles to men and women. In the Neolithic revolution, the work that produced food became relegated to men, and household chores became the women’s job. Men came to be the dominant gender in society. .   . The Bronze Age . During this age people discovered how to use metals instead of stone. The use of metals (copper + tin = bronze) brought the Neolithic period to an end, although many of the skills learned during that time would continue .   .   . NOTE: The use of metals in early history . We call prehistory the Stone Age because most tools were made from stone. Slowly, early man learned to use copper from the ground. The problem with copper is that it is soft and easily bends; it will not keep a sharp edge. At some point, man learned to mix melted copper with melted tin to produce bronze. This technology (a learned technique or skill) produced a metal that was much more useful than copper or tin alone. Bronze could keep a sharp edge. But it was a technology that had to be learned. .   . The problem with bronze was that it was very brittle and would easily break upon contact with armor, bones or rocks. Soon, man learned to make a superior metal: iron. The production of this metal was more complex than that of bronze. Whereas bronze could be produced on an open fire, such fires were not hot enough to produce iron. Man learned to dramatically increase the temperature of fires by blasting air into the coals. This fed the fire more oxygen than it would get from a normal burn. With such fires, iron could be forged. .   . Weapons made from iron stayed sharp and easily shattered bronze weapons. Armies with iron weapons had a significant advantage over armies using stone or other metals. Because its production required additional technological skills, iron-making skills were kept secret by the Hittites who first learned how to make it. .   .   . Bronze was a hard, durable metal. It made better tools. . 1) Farming: food production drastically increased. This meant that people did not have to move around. They could stay in one place and build permanent homes. Once the problem of the food supply was solved, people could also group together in larger numbers and build cities. This is called urbanization. . 4) 4)      Weapons: Because people grouped together in larger numbers, more security was needed. Cities needed walls and large armies for protection. . 5) 5)      Government: all these changes made it necessary to provide more organization. Questions of “who is in control and will make the final decisions?” had to be answered. Kings emerged. .   . In short, The Bronze Age led directly to the birth of a new form of human organization: Civilization. .   . Civilization . The study of history begins with civilization. This is because civilized man has the ability to write things down, and these written records provide historians with clues about their lives. There are several things that make up civilizations: . 1) cities . 2) governments . 3) religion . 4) social distinctions . 5) artistic expression .   . The first civilizations in the world emerged in river valleys in China, India, Africa, and the Middle East. Here is a brief comparison of the river valley civilizations in Africa and the Middle East. .   . The River Valley Civilizations .   . A surplus of agricultural production led to the rise of complex human societies, or civilizations. With the need of agricultural societies to irrigate, it is not surprising that many civilizations emerged in river valleys. The River Valley civilizations that emerged on the Yellow River (China), the Indus River (India), the Nile River (Egypt), and between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers (Mesopotamia) made lasting contributions to civilizations. The following chart compares the important features of a few of these river valley civilizations. As you look over this, attempt to piece together what these civilizations have in common and what differentiates them. .   .   .         .   | Egypt | Mesopotamia | Shang | . Geography | Egypt was protected by natural barriers on all sides. The Nile provided the perfect waterway for trade. Also, the Nile flooded each year at about the same time, a fact that gave them a distinct sense of each year’s passing (they created the calendar to predict this). It also naturally fertilized the land and provided for abundant agriculture. Many people attribute the Egyptians’ optimism (eternal life) on the good fortune of its geography. | The Tigris and Euphrates Rivers flooded randomly and violently without much warning, a condition that probably contributed to their pessimistic view of the gods and fatalistic view of life. Also, Mesopotamia had no natural barriers protecting them from enemy neighbors. They were subject to constant invasion. The rivers facilitated trade and allowed some of the cities to grow quite wealthy. | China is geographically isolated. Although the Shang traded with other civilizations, their limited contact with others produced an ethnocentric outlook. They called their land the Middle Kingdom, an assertion that implied that other people were on the periphery of the civilized world. Their land was fertile and supported a surplus of agriculture without complex irrigations systems. | . Political | Egypt was united under one central government. Egyptians believed the king, or Pharaoh, was a god. This helped keep order because people were more inclined to obey the king if he was a god. Religious myths reinforced this belief. The government was strictly centralized and controlled the resources of the state. | Mesopotamian civilization was made up of many independent city-states that never were able to unit. This made them weak and vulnerable to invasion. However, sometimes the people had to unite to build irrigation canals for their agriculture. They developed written laws, the Code of Hammurabi, which was probably made to give unity to an expanding empire. | Most rule was local, consisting of a network of walled towns whose leaders were loyal to the king. These local leaders comprised the bureaucracy, a group of aristocratic chieftains who could be removed at the kings will. | . Society and Economics | Women had more rights than in most early civilizations. There were certain jobs, however, that women were not allowed to do. The most people in Egypt worked in agriculture. The Nile allowed Egyptians to trade with other civilizations and were in turn influenced by them. | The Code Of Hammurabi reinforced patriarchy and social distinctions. A business class of people operated quite independent of government control. Like in Egypt, most people in Mesopotamia were farmers. Certain cities traded and grew rich. We know they traded with Egypt and India. | The family was the most important social institution. Men had most all of the authority. As villages became more productive, social classes became more distinct. | . Religion | The Egyptians were polytheistic. The lineage of the gods extended to the pharaoh himself who had absolute power and was revered as a god. | The Mesopotamians were polytheistic. Each city-state had its own set of god that it worshipped along with a set of wider known gods. They built monuments called ziggurats to their gods. Their gods were often different manifestations of nature and were invoked to help in good harvests. Interestingly, the Sumerians viewed their gods as disinterested in human beings, probably a result of their unfortunate geographical allotment. | The honor and respect given to family elders was related to the worship of ancestors. Dead ancestors were summoned for advice through oracle bones and other means. Thus religion both drew from and reinforced patriarchy. | .   .   . Additional Notes: . The civilization in Mesopotamia, like that in China and Central America, is a rare example of a civilization that developed from scratch with no precedents to borrow from anyone else. | .   . The River Valley civilizations came up with many things we take for granted such as calendars, the wheel, alphabets, bureaucracies, divisions of time into units of 60, and complex mathematical concepts like square roots. | .   . Not all early complex civilizations had written languages (the civilizations of the Incas, for example.) | .   . Civilizations acquire new practices either through cultural diffusion (the Assyrians learned iron technology from the Hittites) or through independent invention (the Chinese bureaucracy). It is a good idea to know some more examples of these two ways. | .",
