The standard is called Sassy and is the same as used in Python Flask projects. | templates/error - error pages can be placed here. Can you guess were you would put a 500 error page. | application.properties - this resource is used to define defaults for the application. Most of these default are used by backed, for instance this will be used to define location of a database. This is similar to __init__.py. | . .

I have obtained the skill of leadership, as I was the Scrum Master of the RECS group in the second trimester of this year as well as the Dev Ops Lead of the Hectic 6 group in the third trimester of the year. In the former experience, I was responsible for delegating group duties to the rest of my group members and unifying my group members around a central goal, which wasn’t easy compared to other groups given that unlike other groups, my teammates didn’t personally know each other initially. In addition, I’ve learned how to facilitate frontend, backend, and Dev Ops in a major team to the standards of a professional website. . Highs and lows from year . Highs: I took on a massive leadership role in my Trimester 2 group and pulled through with a great project, including several features integrated with APIs coming from important organization such as OpenWeatherMap. Lows: There were definitely some late nights full of stress, but in the end I managed to pull through.

I’m also planning on minoring in Data Science or pursuing in some way after high school. I don’t know if I’m committed enough to be a Comp Sci major, because I’m very interested in Data Science and it is a less competitive major in general, but I definitely want to pursue both interests. In terms of education, I strive for a BS in Computer Science and something in Data Science as well. To be honest, I haven’t thought very long or hard about my entire career, but I also know I have a lot of time to experiment in my life. . other, you pick .

Multiple cells are used to setup HTML in this lesson. Many of the JavaScript cells will use the output tag(s) to write into the HTML that has been setup. . %%html is used to setup HTML code block | &quot;style&quot; tag enables visuals customization | &quot;div&quot; tag is setup to receive data | . %%html &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;style&gt; #output { background-color: #353b45; padding: 10px; border: 3px solid #ccc; } &lt;/style&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;output&quot;&gt; Hello! &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; . . Hello! . output explored . There are several ways to ouput the classic introduction message: &quot;Hello, World!&quot; . Before you go further, open Console on your Browser. JavaScript developer leaves Console open all the time!!! | The function console.log() outputs to Console, this is often used for inspection or debugging. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. Developer call this a hard coded string. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; literal is a parameter to console.log(), element.txt() and alert(). | The element.txt function is part of Jupyter Notebook %%js magic. This is convenient for Notebook and testing. | The alert command outputs the parameter to a dialog box, so you can see it in this Jupyter notebook. The alert commands are shown, but are commented out as the stop run all execution of the notebook. | Note, in a Web Application Debugging: An alert is often used for less savy Developers. Console is used by more savy developers; console often requires setting up a lot of outputs. Source level debugging is the most powerful solution for debugging and does not require alert or console commands. | . %%js // required to allow cell to be JavaScript enabled console.log(&quot;JavaScript/Jupyter Output Intro&quot;); // Browser Console output; debugging or tracing console.log(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); console.log(&quot;Hello, World Again!&quot;); // Document Object Model (DOM) output; output to HTML, CSS which is standard for a Web Page // &lt;mark&gt;select element method&lt;/mark&gt;: DOM native JavaScript get, document.getElementByID document.getElementById(&quot;output&quot;).textContent = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; // &lt;mark&gt;jQuery CSS-style method&lt;/mark&gt;: Tag for DOM selector, $(&#39;#output&#39;) $(&#39;#output&#39;).append(&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hello World Again!&#39;); // br is break or new line, b is bold // Jupyter built in magic element for testing and convenience of development element.text(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); // element is output option as part of %%js magic element.append(&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hello World Again!&#39;); //alert(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); . multiple outputs using one variable . This second example is a new sequence of code, two or more lines of code forms a sequence. This example defines a variable, thank goodness!!! In the previous example we were typing the string &quot;Hello, World&quot; over and over. Observe with the variable msg=&quot;Hello, World!&quot;; we type the string once and now use msg over and over. . The variable &quot;var msg =&quot; is used to capture the data | The console.log(msg) outputs to console, be sure to Inspect it! | The element.text() is part of Jupyter Notebooks and displays as output blow the code on this page. Until we build up some more interesting data for Web Site, we will not use be using the Python HTML, CSS technique. | The alert(msg) works the same as previous, but as the other commands uses msg as parameter. | . %%js console.log(&quot;Variable Definition&quot;); var msg = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; // Use msg to output code to Console and Jupyter Notebook console.log(msg); //right click browser select Inspect, then select Console to view element.text(msg); //alert(msg); . output showing use of a function . This example passes the defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are multiple steps in this code.. The &quot;definition of the function&quot;: &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. Passing a parameter is required when you call this function. | The &quot;call to the function:&quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually runs the function. The variable &quot;msg&quot; is used a parameter when calling the logIt function. | . | Showing reuse of function... There are two calls to the logIt function | This is called Prodedural Abstraction, a term that means reusing the same code | . | . %%js console.log(&quot;Function Definition&quot;); /* Function: logIt * Parameter: output * Description: The parameter is &quot;output&quot; to console and jupyter page */ function logIt(output) { console.log(output); element.append(output + &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;); //alert(output); } // First sequence calling logIt function var msg = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; logIt(msg); // Second sequence calling logIt function var msg = &quot;Hello, &lt;b&gt;Students&lt;/b&gt;!&quot; // replaces content of variable var classOf = &quot;Welcome CS class of 2023-2024.&quot; logIt(msg + &quot; &quot; + classOf); // concatenation of strings . output showing Loosely typed data . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. . To define a variable you prefix the name with var or const. The variable type is determined by JavaScript at runtime. | Python and many interpretive languages are loosely typed like JavaScript. This is considered programmer friendly. | Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see terms like String, Integer, Double, and Object in the source code. | In JavaScript, the typeof keyword returns the type of the variable. Become familiar with type as it is valuable in conversation and knowing type help you understand how to modify data. Each variable type will have built in methods to manage content within the data type. | . %%js console.log(&quot;Examine Data Types&quot;); // Function to add typeof to output function getType(output) { return typeof output + &quot;: &quot; + output; } // Function defintion function logIt(output) { console.log(getType(output)); // logs string console.info(output); // logs object element.append(getType(output) + &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;); // adds to Jupyter output //alert(getType(output)); } // Common Types element.append(&quot;Common Types &lt;br&gt;&quot;); logIt(&quot;Mr M&quot;); // String logIt(1997); // Number logIt(true); // Boolean element.append(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;); // Object Type, this definition is often called a array or list element.append(&quot;Object Type, array &lt;br&gt;&quot;); var scores = [ 90, 80, 100 ]; logIt(scores); element.append(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;); // Complex Object, this definition is often called hash, map, hashmap, or dictionary element.append(&quot;Object Type, hash or dictionary &lt;br&gt;&quot;); var person = { // key:value pairs seperated by comma &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;role&quot;: &quot;Teacher&quot; }; logIt(person); logIt(JSON.stringify(person)); //method used to convert this object into readable format . Build a Person object and JSON . JavaScript and other languages have special properties and syntax to store and represent data. In fact, a class in JavaScript is a special function. . Definition of class allows for a collection of data, the &quot;class Person&quot; allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of a Person. | Instance of a class, the &quot;const teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977)&quot; makes an object &quot;teacher&quot; which is an object representation of &quot;class Person&quot;. | Setting and Getting properties After creating teacher and student objects, observe that properties can be changed/muted or extracted/accessed. | . %%html &lt;!-- load jQuery and tablesorter scripts --&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;!-- load jQuery and tablesorter scripts --&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.tablesorter/2.31.3/js/jquery.tablesorter.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;style&gt; /* CSS-style selector maps to table id or other id&#39;s in HTML */ #jsonTable, #flaskTable { background-color: #353b45; padding: 10px; border: 3px solid #ccc; box-shadow: 0.8em 0.4em 0.4em grey; } &lt;/style&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;!-- Table for writing and extracting jsonText --&gt; &lt;table id=&quot;jsonTable&quot;&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Classroom JSON Data&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td id=&quot;jsonText&quot;&gt;{&quot;classroom&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;object&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;sample&quot;,&quot;ghID&quot;:&quot;sample&quot;,&quot;classOf&quot;:2000,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;sample&quot;}]}&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; . .

We will be focusing on 4 algorithms today. . We will look at the first one together, Bubble Sort . . What is happening with this sort? . Check two values, if it&#39;s smaller they swap, if not, they keep going. . In your groups you will each choose to be an expert on a sorting algorithm. Merge, Selection, and Insertion.

Ex: compare 75 and 17, 75 is greater so switch the two numbers. 75 is greater than 46 so switch the two numbers and continue until all sorted. | Selection Sort- moves all the sorted to the right, and only goes through the unsorted. put 0 in the beginning and put the rest of the list to the right, and find the next smallest number and put it next to 0 which would be 17, then continue.

Then, merge the lists in order, then merge and order the lists. Split into 88, 39, 53, 39, 58 and 43, 74, 81, 71, 51. Keep splitting and then start merging them into order. Once the two lists are sorted merge them together from lowest to gretaest. | Insertion Sort- ideal if part of the list is sorted already, when you get to one that needs to be swapped, you use the one that has been swapped and compare it to the rest of the list. swap 88 and 39, then swap 53 and 88, then compare 39 to all the ones before.

Analysis on Sorting . Comparisons: . number of times the algorithm compares two elements in the list to determine their order. In merge sort, comparisons occur when merging the sub-lists. On each comparison, the algorithm decides which element should come first in the sorted order. . Swaps:&gt; number of times the algorithm exchanges the positions of two elements in the list. In merge sort, swaps do not occur because the algorithm creates a new sorted list by merging the sub-lists. It avoids swapping elements within the original list. Time: . estimate of how the algorithm&#39;s performance scales with the input size. Merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This means that as the list size doubles, the time taken to sort it will increase by a factor of approximately two times the logarithm of the list size. . More Readable Format . def mergeSort(arr, key): comparisons = 0 # Track the number of comparisons swaps = 0 # Track the number of swaps # If the array has 0 or 1 element, it is already sorted if len(arr) &lt;= 1: return arr, comparisons, swaps # split into sublists mid = len(arr) // 2 left = arr[:mid] right = arr[mid:] # Recursively call mergeSort on left and right halves left, left_comparisons, left_swaps = mergeSort(left, key) right, right_comparisons, right_swaps = mergeSort(right, key) # Update the total comparisons and swaps comparisons += left_comparisons + right_comparisons swaps += left_swaps + right_swaps # Merge the sorted left and right halves merged, merge_comparisons, merge_swaps = merge(left, right, key) # Update the total comparisons and swaps comparisons += merge_comparisons swaps += merge_swaps return merged, comparisons, swaps # Rest of the code remains the same... if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: list_of_artists = [ {&quot;artist&quot;: &quot;Lizzy McAlpine&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 23, &quot;album&quot;: &quot;Five Seconds Flat&quot;}, {&quot;artist&quot;: &quot;Lorde&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 26, &quot;album&quot;: &quot;Solar Power&quot;}, {&quot;artist&quot;: &quot;grandson&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 29, &quot;album&quot;: &quot;I Love You, I&#39;m Trying&quot;}, {&quot;artist&quot;: &quot;Bazzi&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 25, &quot;album&quot;: &quot;Infinite Dream&quot;} ] key_row = list_of_artists[0] print(&quot;Original List:&quot;) for artist in list_of_artists: for key, value in artist.items(): if key != &quot;artist&quot;: print(f&quot;{key}: {value}&quot;) print(&quot;&quot;) # Sorting and printing with merge sort for key in key_row: sorted_list, comparisons, swaps = mergeSort(list_of_artists, key) print(f&quot; nSorted List by &#39;{key}&#39;:&quot;) for artist in sorted_list: for key, value in artist.items(): if key != &quot;artist&quot;: print(f&quot;{key}: {value}&quot;) print(&quot;&quot;) print(&quot;Comparisons:&quot;, comparisons) print(&quot;Swaps:&quot;, swaps) .

Answer B, which states that “first = 100, second = 200”, is incorrect. The variable second, while initially assigned the value 200, is later assigned the value of temp, which is 100. Answer A, which states that “first = 100, second = 100”, is correct. The variable first is initially assigned the value 100 and the variable second is initially assigned the value 200. Next, temp is assigned the value of first, which is 100. Next, second is assigned the value of temp, which is 100. Last, first is assigned the value of second, which is 100. After execution, both first and second have the value 100. . Question 12: . Answer D is incorrect. For each iteration of the loop, this code segment moves the robot forward if there is an open square in front of the robot. Otherwise, the robot rotates left. In the first five iterations of the loop, the robot moves forward five squares to the top of the grid. In the next two iterations of the loop, the robot rotates left two times. In the next five iterations of the loop, the robot moves forward five squares to the bottom of the grid. In the next two iterations of the loop, the robot rotates left two times. The robot continues in an infinite loop, repeatedly moving from the bottom of the grid to the top of the grid and back. Answer C is correct. For each iteration of the loop, this code segment rotates the robot left if there is an open square to its left. Then, whether or not the robot rotates left, the code segment attempts to move the robot forward one square. In the first three iterations of the loop, the robot moves forward three squares from its initial location. In the next iteration of the loop, it rotates left. In the next three iterations of the loop, it moves forward three squares. In the next iteration of the loop, it rotates left. In the last three iterations of the loop, it moves forward three squares to the gray square at the bottom left corner of the grid. . Question 23: . Answer C, which states that “The Internet requires all communications to use encryption protocols.”, is incorrect. The Internet was not designed to be completely secure. Encryption is not required for communications. Answer B, which states that “The Internet is designed to scale to support an increasing number of users.”, is correct. The Internet was designed to be scalable, using open protocols to easily connect additional computing devices to the network. . Question 63: . Answer B, which states that “(NOT input1) AND (NOT input2)”, incorrect. For example, when input1 is true and input2 is false, then (NOT input1) will be false and (NOT input2) will be true. Therefore, (NOT input1) AND (NOT input2) will be false instead of the intended value true. Answer A, which states that “(NOT input1) OR (NOT input2)”, is correct. When input1 and input2 are both true, the expressions (NOT input1) and (NOT input2) are both false, so (NOT input1) OR (NOT input2) will evaluate to false. In all other cases, either (NOT input1) or (NOT input2) (or both) will evaluate to true, so (NOT input1) OR (NOT input2) will evaluate to true. . Question 69: . Answer A, which states that “Determining the chronological order of the photos”, is correct. The time and date that a photo is taken is considered metadata about the image. This information can be used to determine the chronological order of the images. Answer D, which states that “Determining whether two photos were taken at the same location on different days”, is correct. The location and date that a photo is taken is considered metadata about the image. This information can be used to determine whether two pictures were taken at the same location on different dates. .",

            "title": "SASS",
            "content": "Why SASS? . SASS is an improvement on CSS in that there are methods of abstraction. It is a stylesheet language that is compiled into CSS, which means that SASS code will be translated in CSS code, which is what your web browser can read. . SASS vs SCSS . As you learn about Sass, you might notice something called Scss. They are basically the same thing except that Scss uses curly braces and semicolons to distinguish between lines. Sass uses indentation and newlines instead. . We will be teaching the Scss syntax because it is more commonly used. . Getting started . A easy way to write SASS and have it preprocessed into CSS is by using a Jekyll powered website, such as GitHub pages or Fastpages. . The first step is to clone a GitHub pages repo, such as this one. . Within the repository, head over to assets/css/, and open style.scss. . This is where you can create your SASS code. . To see your CSS-translated SASS code, head over to _site/assets/css/style.css . Note: You will need to run bundle exec jekyll serve before the _site directory appears. . The first few hundred lines are used to style Github&#39;s theme. Make sure to scroll to the very bottom to see the SASS code that you wrote, which is in the form of CSS. . Nesting . When writing CSS, you may observe that several selectors are linked to the same element. For instance, suppose you have a div element that manages the font and two other divs inside it that control font size. In this case, your CSS code may have separate selectors for each div element. . SASS has a nesting feature that allows you to write CSS in a way that reflects the HTML hierarchy, making it easier to read and understand. In SASS, you can nest the font-size and font-family properties under the .title and .text classes within the .font class. . To illustrate, the CSS code above can be rewritten in SASS as shown below: . .font { .title { font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 3em; } .text { font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 1em; } } . The resulting HTML code for the SASS code above would be: . &lt;div class=&quot;font&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Title&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;text&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is some text&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; . Mini-hack . Write out the SASS equivalent for the following CSS code: . .a .b { color: green; } .a .c { color: blue; } . SASS Equivalent . .a { .b { color: green; } .c { color: blue; } } . Extend/Inheritance . What are some similarities that the buttons share? What are the differences? . All buttons share the same attributes such as width, height, font color, and spacing between buttons but differ in background color. Writing out these properties for each button selector in CSS can be cumbersome. Fortunately, SASS provides a feature called a placeholder class, which allows us to store reusable code. . To specify the width, height, font color, and spacing for each button, we can create a placeholder class called %buttonLayout and write our styling in there. This placeholder class acts as a template for the specific buttons we want to make. . To apply the styling from the %buttonLayout class to each button, we need to create a selector for each button and use @extend %class-name to call the code from the placeholder class. . For example, we can write: . .gettingStartedButton, .nestingButton, .extendButton { @extend %buttonLayout; } . At this point, all buttons will have the same styling. However, we can still make each one unique by customizing the background color for each button individually within their respective selectors. . For instance, we can write: . .gettingStartedButton { background: radial-gradient( #1539db, #8a8ce6); } .nestingButton { background: radial-gradient( #3a9fa7, #8ae0e6); } .extendButton { background: radial-gradient( #643aa7, #d78ae6); } . This will give each button its own background color while retaining the common styling attributes from the %buttonLayout class. . Mixin . Let&#39;s examine the buttons once again. . We applied a background to the buttons using background: radial-gradient(). There is another method to code for the background, which involves using a mixin. . A mixin functions like extend, as it creates a code template that can be reused. It can also take parameters to enable you to create dynamic styling. . For instance, all three buttons have a gradient background. Nonetheless, the background colors differ. With SASS, you can create a @mixin at-rule that accepts two colors as parameters: . @mixin buttonLayout($innerColor, $outerColor) { . css Copy code background: radial-gradient($innerColor, $outerColor); } . To call the mixin, make a selector and invoke the mixin with @include: . The following code sets the background color of the Getting Started button to a blue gradient. . .gettingStartedButton { less Copy code @include buttonLayout(#1539db, #8a8ce6); } Additionally, you can also include styling rules that don&#39;t accept variables inside a mixin. The code below shows how to style the remainder of the button inside a mixin: @mixin buttonLayout($innerColor, $outerColor) { css background: radial-gradient($innerColor, $outerColor); width: 15em; height: 15em; color: #ffffff; margin-right: 10%; border-radius: 2em; } . Mini-hack . Write out a mixin in SASS that takes in a color and a font size as the parameter. Within the mixin, set the background color and font color to the color parameter, and set the font size to the font size parameter. Then create a selector that calls the mixin, and pass in a color and font size of your choice as the arguments. . // Example 1: Nesting .font { .title { font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 3em; } .text { font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 1em; } } // Example 2: Placeholder Class and Extend %buttonLayout { width: 15em; height: 15em; color: #ffffff; margin-right: 10%; } .gettingStartedButton, .nestingButton, .extendButton { @extend %buttonLayout; } .gettingStartedButton { background: radial-gradient(#1539db, #8a8ce6); } .nestingButton { background: radial-gradient(#3a9fa7, #8ae0e6); } .extendButton { background: radial-gradient(#643aa7, #d78ae6); } // Example 3: Mixin @mixin buttonLayout($innerColor, $outerColor) { background: radial-gradient($innerColor, $outerColor); width: 15em; height: 15em; color: #ffffff; margin-right: 10%; border-radius: 2em; } .gettingStartedButton { @include buttonLayout(#1539db, #8a8ce6); } // Example 4: Mixin with Parameters @mixin colorAndFontSize($color, $fontSize) { background-color: $color; color: $color; font-size: $fontSize; } .myElement { @include colorAndFontSize(#ff0000, 16px); } . Function . Functions Click the button below to toggle between light and dark mode: . Click me To change between light and dark mode, we can create an invert function in SASS. . Functions in SASS look like this: . @function name(parameters) { . //code @return value; . } . A function can be created that takes in an rgb value and returns the inverted rgb color. . To invert colors, subtract each rgb value from 255. . The function looks something like this: . @function sassInvert($r, $g, $b) { . $newColor: rgb(255 - $r, 255 - $g, 255 - $b); @return $newColor; . } . Functions are called by specifying the function name with parenthesis. Inside the parenthesis, you can specify the arguments. . For instance, the invert selector looks like this: . .invert { . background-color: sassInvert(0, 0, 0); color: sassInvert(211,202,202); . } . Import . After configuring a lot of styling, your SASS file might get cluttered. . style.scss location There is a way to split your code into multiple files and import them into one file. . For instance, to put the styling for function.html in another SASS file, first create a directory called _sass. . Within the directory, create another SASS file. In this case, the file is called functionStyle.scss . Write your SASS code in that file. Once you are finished, switch back to style.scss and import the file with @import &quot;file-name&quot; . For instance, to import the functionStyle.scss file into style.scss , the import statement would be @import &quot;functionStyle&quot;. . SASS Hacks . Take notes and complete the mini-hacks.

More points will be given if both are done. | Extra Credit: . SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a CSS preprocessor that adds features and functionality to traditional CSS. In this blog post, we will explore some additional SASS features that were not covered in the previous examples. . Variables SASS allows the use of variables to store values that can be used throughout your stylesheet. This is useful for values that are used repeatedly, such as colors or font sizes. Here is an example of how to define a variable in SASS: $primary-color: #4CAF50; . The variable can then be used throughout the stylesheet using the variable name. This allows for easy changes to be made throughout the stylesheet by only changing the value of the variable. . Loops SASS also supports loops, which allows for repeated CSS declarations to be generated based on a set of values. This can be useful for generating a large number of CSS rules with similar properties. Here is an example of how to use a loop to generate a set of classes with increasing font sizes: @for $i from 1 through 5 { . .font-#{$i} { . css Copy code font-size: 10px + $i * 2px; } . } . This will generate the following CSS: . .font-1 { . font-size: 12px; . } . .font-2 { . font-size: 14px; . } . .font-3 { . font-size: 16px; . } . .font-4 { . font-size: 18px; . } . .font-5 { . font-size: 20px; . } . Functions SASS also has a number of built-in functions that can be used to manipulate values. For example, the lighten() function can be used to lighten a color by a certain percentage. Here is an example of how to use the lighten() function: $primary-color: #4CAF50; . .secondary-color { . background-color: lighten($primary-color, 20%); . } . This will generate CSS that sets the background-color of .secondary-color to a lighter version of the $primary-color variable. . Mixins with Arguments Mixins in SASS can also take arguments, which allows for more dynamic styling. Here is an example of a mixin that takes a color and font size as arguments: @mixin heading($color, $size) { . color: $color; . font-size: $size; . } . This mixin can then be used to generate styles for different headings, with different colors and font sizes. Here is an example of how to use the heading mixin: . h1 { . @include heading(#4CAF50, 24px); . } . h2 { . @include heading(#2196F3, 20px); . } . h3 { . @include heading(#9C27B0, 16px); . } . Operators SASS supports a number of operators that can be used to manipulate values. For example, the + operator can be used to add values together. Here is an example of how to use the + operator: $font-size: 14px; . h1 { . font-size: $font-size + 2px; . } . This will generate CSS that sets the font-size of h1 to 16px. . In conclusion, SASS is a powerful tool that extends the functionality of CSS. It offers features such as variables, loops, functions, mixins with arguments, and operators that allow for more dynamic and efficient styling. By using SASS, you can write more concise and maintainable stylesheets that are easier to work with and modify. .",

            "content": "Introduction . Frontend and backend are two essential components of a web application. The frontend is the part of the application that interacts with the user, whereas the backend is the part that handles the logic and data processing behind the scenes. . The frontend, also known as the client-side, typically consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that runs in the user&#39;s web browser. The frontend handles the user interface, page layout, and overall look of the application. It also handles user interactions, such as submitting forms, clicking buttons, and navigating between pages. . On the other hand, the backend, also known as the server-side, typically consists of a server, a database, and, in our case, APIs. The backend handles the processing and storage of data, manages user authentication and authorization, and handles business logic and rules. The backend also communicates with the frontend, providing the necessary data to render the user interface and processing user inputs. . Backend . In our class we mainly use Python and SQL/JSON to create APIs and databases. Here is a simple example of creating a SQL database and using CRUD as well. . What is CRUD . C: The &#39;C&#39; stands for create, meaning to create a new entry in a database. In this case, creating a new entry about a certain movie or TV show. . | R: Read, or to retrieve data from the database. In this case it is selecting the movie/TV shwo that you choose to display. . | U: Update, or changing an existing entry in the database. In this case it is selecting the preexisting movie/TV show and changing the values to match what you want. . | D: Delete, or removing data from the database. In this case it is selecting the preexisting movie/TV show and removing the entry from the database. . | . Films API . This API is intended to be used as a list of movies and TV shows that a person has watched. It includes attributes for the Film name(key), the year released, the language, the number of episodes, A list of the number of episodes(using pickletype), and a youtube url for the trailer. The CRUD works as follows: Create: Enter the above mentioned attributes Read: Returns all of the films and their attributes Update: Takes in new episodes watched, and a list of their names, and adds them to their respective attibutes Delete: Option for deleting every film, also takes in a name to delete that film if it exists . from flask import Flask import sqlite3 app = Flask(__name__) # Connect to the SQLite database using SQLite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;films.db&#39;) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() # Create a table in the database cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE movies (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, title TEXT, year INTEGER, epcount INTEGER, language TEXT, trailer TEXT, eplist TEXT)&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit the changes to the database and close the connection conn.commit() conn.close() . import sqlite3 def create(): # Ask the user for movie details title = input(&quot;Enter the movie/tv show title: &quot;) year = input(&quot;Enter the movie/tv show release year: &quot;) epcount = input(&quot;Enter the movie/tv show epcount: &quot;) language = input(&quot;Enter the movie/tv show language: &quot;) eplist = input(&quot;Enter the movie/tv show episode names: &quot;) trailer = input(&quot;Enter the link movie/tv show trailer: &quot;) # Connect to the database and create a cursor to execute SQL commands database = &#39;films.db&#39; connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Execute SQL to insert record into db cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO movies (title, year, epcount, language, eplist, trailer) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (title, year, epcount, language, eplist, trailer)) # Commit the changes connection.commit() print(f&quot;{title} has been added to the list of movies.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while inserting record:&quot;, error) # Close cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() create() .

Where do you store the JavaScript Code? | How do you import a JS file into HTML? | What is onClick? | What tag do you use to write JavaScript code? | Where do you store the JavaScript code? JavaScript code can be stored in various ways depending on the requirements of the application. For smaller applications, JavaScript code can be directly written inside an HTML file using the This imports the JavaScript file into the HTML file, and the code in the JavaScript file can be executed when the HTML file is loaded in the browser. . What is onClick? onClick is an event in JavaScript that is triggered when an HTML element is clicked. When an onClick event occurs, the JavaScript code associated with the event is executed. This event is commonly used in web applications to perform actions based on user interaction. For example, if we have a button with the id &#39;myButton&#39;, we can add an onClick event to the button that displays an alert when the button is clicked, like this: html Copy code . Click Me When the button is clicked, an alert box will be displayed with the message &#39;Button clicked!&#39;. . What tag do you use to write JavaScript code?

            "title": "Notebook - Data Related to User Guide",
            "content": "NOTE . As you follow along, make sure to fill in the blanks and complete the coding exercises! . Introduction . When building an application that requires users to create accounts or sign in, handling data related to users is crucial. This data can include things like user profiles, preferences, and activity logs, which can be used to personalize the user experience and improve the application&#39;s performance. . For example, by storing a user&#39;s name and profile picture, the application can address the user by name and display their picture, creating a more personal experience. Activity logs can also be used to track user behavior and help the application recommend new features or improvements. . By learning how to handle data related to users effectively and responsibly, you&#39;ll be equipped with the skills and knowledge needed to build robust and user-friendly applications that meet the needs of your users. . For simplicity purposes, we will be lecturing on how one can store and manipulate user data for future utilization. . Here we go! . Establishing Class/User Data and making a new user . In Python, classes are templates used to create objects, which are instances of those classes. Classes define the data elements (_) and methods that describe the behavior of the objects. Let&#39;s explore how to define a class and create objects in Python. . Example: Defining a User class . class User: def __init__(self, username, email): self.username = username self.email = email def display_info(self): print(f&quot;Username: {self.username}, Email: {self.email}&quot;) . In this example, we define a User class with a constructor method init that takes username and email as arguments. The display_info method is used to print the user information. . In the context of backend functionality, this class can be used to create, manipulate, and manage user data. For example, when a new user signs up for an account, you could create a new User object with their username and email. This object can then be used to perform various operations, such as validating the user&#39;s input, storing the user&#39;s data in a database, or processing user-related requests. . Creating a new user: . new_user = User(&quot;john_doe&quot;, &quot;john@example.com&quot;) new_user.display_info() . Username: john_doe, Email: john@example.com . Lecture Topics: . Establishing Class/User Data and making a new user . In Python, classes are templates used to create objects, which are instances of those classes. Classes define the data elements (attributes) and methods that describe the behavior of the objects. Let&#39;s explore how to define a class and create objects in Python. . Example: Defining a User class . class User: def init(self, username, email): self.username = username self.email = email . def display_info(self): print(f&quot;Username: {self.username}, Email: {self.email}&quot;) . In this example, we define a User class with a constructor method init that takes username and email as arguments. The display_info method is used to print the user information. . Creating a new user: . python . new_user = User(&quot;john_doe&quot;, &quot;john@example.com&quot;) new_user.display_info() . Here, we create a new User object, new_user, with a specified username and email. We then call the display_info method to display the user&#39;s information. . Using property decorators (getter and setter) . Properety decarators allow developers to access and modify instance data more concisely. The @property decorator creates a getter method, while the @attribute.setter decorator creates a setter method. . Example: . class Employee: def __init__(self, employee_id, name): self._employee_id = employee_id self._name = name @property def name(self): return self._name @name.setter def name(self, new_name): self._name = new_name . In this example, the Employee class has a name attribute, which is accessed and modified through the name property getter and setter methods. The _name attribute uses an underscore prefix, which is a convention to indicate it should not be accessed directly. . In the context of backend functionality, this Employee class can be used to model employees within an application. You can create instances of this class to store and manage employee data, and the getter and setter methods can be used to access and modify employee information in a controlled way. . Usage: . employee = Employee(1001, &quot;John Doe&quot;) print(employee.name) # Get the name using the getter method employee.name = &quot;Jane Doe&quot; # Set the name using the setter method print(employee.name) . John Doe Jane Doe . employee = Employee(1001, &quot;John Doe&quot;) print(employee.name) # Get the name using the getter method . employee.name = &quot;Jane Doe&quot; # Set the name using the setter method print(employee.name) . In the context of backend functionality, the getter and setter methods provide a clean and controlled way to access and modify the attributes of an object. This can be particularly useful when interacting with databases, APIs, or other parts of a web application that require the management and manipulation of object attributes. . CHECK: Explain the function of getters and setters in your own words. . Getter allow you to get data from the model while setters allow you to set data . class Car: def __init__(self, make, model, year): self._make = make self._model = model self._year = year @property def make(self): return self._make @make.setter def make(self, new_make): self._make = new_make @property def model(self): return self._model @model.setter def model(self, new_model): self._model = new_model @property def year(self): return self._year @year.setter def year(self, new_year): self._year = new_year . Take notes here on property decorators and the purpose they serve: . Property decorators are part of Python. They allow certain class methods to do special things Setters and getters are examples of this . Students can then practice creating instances of their Car class and using the getter and setter methods to access and modify the car attributes. . In the context of backend functioanlity, this Car class can be used to model cars within an application. You can create instances of this class to store and manage car data, and the getter and setter methods can be used to access and modify car information in a controlled way. . Overview . WE COVERED: In conclusion, we have covered essential concepts in object-oriented programming using Python, including: . Defining classes and creating objects Property decorators (getter and setter) Class methods and static methods Inheritance and method overriding Working with multiple objects and class attributes . These concepts provide a solid foundation for understanding how to model real-world entities using classes and objects in Python. By learning to work with classes, objects, and their methods, students can develop more efficient and modular code. . As students become more comfortable with these concepts, they can explore more advanced topics, such as multiple inheritance, abstract classes, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Additionally, they can apply these principles to practical projects like web development with Flask and SQLite, as discussed earlier. . Overall, mastering object-oriented programming will greatly enhance students&#39; ability to develop complex and maintainable software systems. . Databases and SQlite . SQLite is a software library that provides a relational database management system. Unlike other databases, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, SQLite is embedded within an application, which means it does not require a separate server process to operate. This makes SQLite a great choice for small-scale applications or for use in situations where you don&#39;t want to set up a full database server. . In this lesson, we will be demonstrating how to set up a SQLite database in Flask, which provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with SQLite databases, and we&#39;ll walk through the process of setting up a new database, creating tables, and adding data. We&#39;ll also cover some basic SQL commands that you can use to interact with your database, including CREATE TABLE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE. By the end of this lesson, you&#39;ll have a good understanding of how to work with SQLite databases in Flask and be ready to start building your own applications. . Setting up a SQLite database in Flask . One of the key features of Flask is its ability to work seamlessly with databases, including SQLite. A database is a collection of data stored in an organized manner that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. . SQlite databse in Flask . from flask import Flask import sqlite3 # Create a Flask application app = Flask(__name__) # Connect to the SQLite database using SQLite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;example.db&#39;) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() # Create a table in the database using SQL commands cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE example_table (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, age INTEGER)&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() .

Basic SQL commands (create, read, update, delete) . SQL is really useful because it helps people do a bunch of things with the data stored in databases. For example, they can use it to create new tables to organize data, add new data to a table, update data that&#39;s already there, or delete data that&#39;s no longer needed. . CRUD is an acronym that stands for the fundamental operations that can be performed on a database, which are Create, Read, Update, and Delete. A widely-used lightweight database management system is SQLite, which can be easily integrated with different programming languages. . C: To create a new record in a database, you must first define the table structure that will store the data. This can be accomplished using SQL commands such as CREATE. Once the table is created, data can be added to it using the INSERT INTO command. . | R: To retrieve data from the database, you can use the READ command. You can specify which fields you want to retrieve and the conditions you want to apply using the WHERE clause. There are also several functions available to aggregate and manipulate data. . | U: To modify existing data in the database, you can use the UPDATE command. You will need to specify which table and fields you want to update, and the conditions you want to apply using the WHERE clause. . | D: To remove data from the database, you can use the DELETE command . | . Take notes here on the basic components of SQL: . SQL has CRUD, or Create, Update, Read, and Delete SQL is a database / data container Conn lets you to have permision to do things you would otherwise complete in an SQLite termina . Property decorators are part of Python. They allow certain class methods to do special things Setters and getters are examples of this . import sqlite3 def menu(): operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete&quot;) if operation.lower() == &#39;c&#39;: create() elif operation.lower() == &#39;r&#39;: read() elif operation.lower() == &#39;u&#39;: update() elif operation.lower() == &#39;d&#39;: delete() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) . a has been added to the list of coding professors. Please enter c, r, u, or d Please enter c, r, u, or d . This block of code is a menu function that helps with create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks and displays the schema. The menu function acts as a control point that directs the program to call different functions based on what the user wants to do. When users enter their preferred action, the input is checked to see which function to use. The menu function is created with no arguments and is called repeatedly, displaying the menu options until the user decides to leave. . Creating a Database . import sqlite3 def create_database(): # Connect to the database (will create it if it doesn&#39;t exist) connection = sqlite3.connect(&#39;instance/professors.db&#39;) cursor = connection.cursor() # Create the professors table if it doesn&#39;t already exist cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS professors ( name TEXT, field TEXT, rating REAL, reviews TEXT )&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit changes and close the connection connection.commit() connection.close() # Call the function to create the database create_database() . Create Function: . import sqlite3 def create(): database = &#39;instance/professors.db&#39; name = input(&quot;Enter the professor&#39;s name: &quot;) field = input(&quot;Enter the professor&#39;s field of expertise: &quot;) rating = input(&quot;Enter the professor&#39;s rating (out of 10): &quot;) reviews = input(&quot;Enter any reviews or comments about the professor: &quot;) # Connect to the database and create a cursor to execute SQL commands connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Execute SQL to insert record into db cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO professors (name, field, rating, reviews) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (name, field, rating, reviews)) # Commit the changes connection.commit() print(f&quot;{name} has been added to the list of coding professors.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while inserting record&quot;, error) # Close cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() create() . sean yeung has been added to the list of coding professors. . The create function allows users to input information about a coding professor and store it in a SQLite database named &#39;professors.db&#39;. This script prompts the user for the professor&#39;s name, field of expertise, rating out of 10, and any reviews or comments about the professor. It then establishes a connection to the SQLite database and creates a cursor object for executing SQL commands. . Read Function . import sqlite3 def read(): try: # Open a connection to the database and create a cursor connection = sqlite3.connect(&#39;instance/professors.db&#39;) cursor = connection.cursor() # Fetch all records from the professors table cursor.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM professors&quot;) rows = cursor.fetchall() # If there are any records, print them if len(rows) &gt; 0: print(&quot;List of coding professors:&quot;) for row in rows: print(f&quot;Name: {row[0]} nField of expertise: {row[1]} nRating: {row[2]} nReviews: {row[3]} n&quot;) else: print(&quot;There are no coding professors in the list.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while connecting to the database:&quot;, error) finally: # Close the cursor and the connection to the database cursor.close() connection.close() read() . List of coding professors: Name: sean yeung Field of expertise: cs Rating: 11.0 Reviews: very good . This code demonstrates how to read data from a SQLite database using Python and the sqlite33 library. The first step is to establish a connection to the database and create a cursor object to execute SQL commands. Then, a SELECT query is executed to fetch all records from the &quot;professors&quot; table. If there are any records, the code iterates through each record and prints out the name, field of expertise, rating, and reviews for each coding professor. If there are no records in the table, a message indicating so is printed. . Update Function . import sqlite3 def update(): database = &#39;instance/professors.db&#39; connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Get the professor&#39;s name to update name = input(&quot;Enter the name of the professor to update: &quot;) # Retrieve the current record from the database cursor.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM professors WHERE name=?&quot;, (name,)) record = cursor.fetchone() # If the professor is found, update the record if record: print(&quot;Enter the new information for the professor:&quot;) field = input(f&quot;Current field: {record[1]} nNew field: &quot;) rating = input(f&quot;Current rating: {record[2]} nNew rating: &quot;) reviews = input(f&quot;Current reviews: {record[3]} nNew reviews: &quot;) # Execute SQL to update the record cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE professors SET field=?, rating=?, reviews=? WHERE name=?&quot;, (field, rating, reviews, name)) connection.commit() print(f&quot;{name}&#39;s record has been updated.&quot;) # If the professor is not found, notify the user else: print(f&quot;No record found for {name}.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while updating record&quot;, error) # Close cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() update () . Enter the new information for the professor: sean yeung&#39;s record has been updated. . This is an implementation of an update function for the professors database using the sqlite3 module in Python. The function first establishes a connection to the database file &#39;instance/professors.db&#39; and creates a cursor object to execute commands. It prompts the user to enter the name of the professor to update and retrieves the corresponding record from the database using a SELECT statement with a WHERE clause to match the professor&#39;s name. If the professor is found in the database, the user is prompted to enter new information for the professor&#39;s field of expertise, rating, and reviews. The function then executes an statement with the new information to update the record in the database. . Delete Function . import sqlite3 def delete(): # Connect to the database and create a cursor connection = sqlite3.connect(&#39;instance/professors.db&#39;) cursor = connection.cursor() # Prompt the user for the name of the professor to delete name = input(&quot;Enter the name of the professor you want to delete: &quot;) # Use a SQL query to find the professor with the given name cursor.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM professors WHERE name=?&quot;, (name,)) row = cursor.fetchone() # If the professor exists, confirm deletion and delete the record if row: confirm = input(f&quot;Are you sure you want to delete {name}? (y/n): &quot;) if confirm.lower() == &#39;y&#39;: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM professors WHERE name=?&quot;, (name,)) connection.commit() print(f&quot;{name} has been deleted from the list of coding professors.&quot;) else: print(f&quot;{name} not found in the list of coding professors.&quot;) # Close the cursor and the connection to the database cursor.close() connection.close() delete() . found not found in the list of coding professors. . This code is a Python function for __ a record from a SQLite database. The function prompts the user to input the name of the professor they want to delete. It then uses a SQL query to search for the professor in the database. If the professor is found, the user is prompted to confirm the deletion. If the user confirms, the function executes a SQL command to delete the record from the database. The function also prints a message confirming that the professor has been deleted from the list of coding professors. If the professor is not found in the database, the function prints a message indicating that the professor is not in the list. . Our Project ... in the works . SAM Messaging System .

All of the topics below are things that have been heavily covered and used throughout the class. We will mostly be focusing on more complicated uses and mechanics of these topics. . Lists . What are Lists? Lists are an ordered sequence of elements, where each element is a variable | Unlike dictionaries, lists&#39; keys are all integers that describe the order of the list | . | . Some examples of lists: . Playlist of songs | names of students in a class | contacts on your phone . | Each element of a string is referenced by an index (which is a number) and they generally start 0 but for the AP Exam it starts at 1. . AP Exam: 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. | Python: 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. | . | . How do lists Manage Complexity of a program? . We may not need as many variables. For example: One Variable that holds all students would be better than having a variable for EACH student | There can also be a list of test scores so if they need to be curved then the same calculation can be applied to the list (that has all the students) instead of doing the calculations one at a time | . | . Answer the following questions about the code block below: . Why do you think lists are helpful? What word does College Board like to use to describe the function of lists? | . Lists are helpful in programming because they allow us to store and manipulate a collection of items or values. Lists enable us to perform operations such as adding or removing elements, accessing specific elements by index, and iterating over all elements. The College Board likes to use the term &quot;abstraction&quot; to describe the function of lists in programming. Lists abstract away the details of how the individual elements are stored in memory, allowing programmers to work with collections of elements as a single entity. This makes it easier to write and understand code that deals with multiple values at once, without having to worry about the low-level details of how they are represented in the computer&#39;s memory. . # variable of type string name = &quot;Sri Kotturi&quot; print(&quot;name&quot;, name, type(name)) # variable of type integer age = 16 print(&quot;age&quot;, age, type(age)) # variable of type float score = 90.0 print(&quot;score&quot;, score, type(score)) print() # variable of type list (many values in one variable) langs = [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;, &quot;Bash&quot;, &quot;html&quot;] print(&quot;langs&quot;, langs, type(langs)) print(&quot;- langs[2]&quot;, langs[2], type(langs[2])) print() # variable of type dictionary (a group of keys and values) person = { &quot;name&quot;: name, &quot;age&quot;: age, &quot;score&quot;: score, &quot;langs&quot;: langs } print(&quot;person&quot;, person, type(person)) print(&#39;- person[&quot;name&quot;]&#39;, person[&quot;name&quot;], type(person[&quot;name&quot;])) . name Sri Kotturi &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; age 16 &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; score 90.0 &lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt; langs [&#39;Python&#39;, &#39;JavaScript&#39;, &#39;Java&#39;, &#39;Bash&#39;, &#39;html&#39;] &lt;class &#39;list&#39;&gt; - langs[2] Java &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; person {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;Sri Kotturi&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 16, &#39;score&#39;: 90.0, &#39;langs&#39;: [&#39;Python&#39;, &#39;JavaScript&#39;, &#39;Java&#39;, &#39;Bash&#39;, &#39;html&#39;]} &lt;class &#39;dict&#39;&gt; - person[&#34;name&#34;] Sri Kotturi &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; . Mathematical Expressions . What is the output of the cell below? What Mathematical Expressions do you see being used? (List them below.) . 10 | addition and division | . grade1 = 10 grade2 = grade1 average_grade = (grade1 + grade2) // 2 #what are these two slashes? print(average_grade) . 10 . What is the value of num1, num2, and num3? Explain how each number ended up what it was. . num1=4096 which is 4^6 | num3=4096 remainder when divided by 5, which is 1 | num2=(4096+1) divided by 9 = 455 | . num1 = 2 num2 = 4 num3 = 6 num1 = num2 ** num3 num3 = num1 % 5 num2 = (num1 + num3) // 9 print(num1) print(num2) print(num3) . 4096 455 1 . Selection . Selection refers to the process of making decisions in a program based on certain conditions. It is normally done with conditional statements. . Conditionals . What is a conditional?: . Statement that allows code to execute different instructions if a certain condition is true or false | Allows program to make decisions based on data and input | . What are the main types of conditional statements?: . if | elif | else | . If statements . The if statement is used to check if a certain condition is true. The condition can be any expression that evaulates to a boolean value, True or False. If the condition is True, then it executes a code block. | If (condition) then (consequence) | Example: | . x = int(input(&quot;Enter a number&quot;)) if x &gt; 0: # if condition, check if this is true of false print(&quot;x is positive&quot;) # code that will execute if condition is met . Enter a number11 x is positive . Else . The else statemnt executes a code block when the if condition is False. | If (condition) then (consequence A), else (consequence B) | . Elif . The elif statement can check multiple conditions in a sequence, and execute a certain block of code if any of the conditions are true. | If (condition) then (consequence A), elif (condition) then (consequence B), else (consequence C) | . Example adding onto the code from before to take negative numbers and 0 into account | . x = int(input(&quot;Enter a number, x:&quot;)) if x &gt; 0: # if condition, check if this is true of false print(&quot;x is positive&quot;) # code that will execute if condition is met elif x &lt; 0: # if previous condition not true... elif condition, check if this is true of false print(&quot;x is negative&quot;)# code that will execute if condition is met else: # everything else, in this case it is if x == 0 print(&quot;x is zero&quot;) # only executes if all previous conditions are not met . Enter a number, x:8 x is positive . Nested Conditionals . What is a nested conditional?: . Conditional statement inside another conditional statement | Allows to check for more complex condition where one condition depends on another | . Nested Conditional Statements . Example | . x = int(input(&quot;Enter a number, x:&quot;)) if x % 2 == 0: print(&quot;x is even divisible by 2&quot;) # only ever checks is x is divisble by 3 if x is even. nested conditional if x % 3 == 0: print(&quot;x is divisible by 3&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is not divisible by 3&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is odd&quot;) . Enter a number, x:11 x is odd . Indentation . When using conditionals and nested conditionals in Python, it is important to pay attention to the level of indentation in the code. The code inside the if, elif, and else blocks must be indented so they are nested wihtin the outer statements. This way, Python knows which code belongs to which block. . Binary Search . What is binary search and what is it used for?: . Searching algorithm | Find and select a specific element in a sorted list of elements | . How does binary search work?: . Repeatedly divides the search interval in half to find the middle element and compares the middle value to the target value, if not the same then it continues on to either the lower or upper half | Eliminate half of the remaining search interval elements each time | Efficient way to search for element in large dataset | . What is the time complexity and why?: . O(log(N)) | The maximum number of iterations is the amount of times the list can be divided in half until it reaches 1 number | Dividing by 2, so it is log2(N), logarigthm of n base 2 . | You may recognize the example below from the binary lesson last Friday . | . import random def binary_search_game(): low = 1 high = 100 target = random.randint(low, high) while True: guess = (low + high) // 2 print(f&quot;Is your number {guess}?&quot;) response = input(&quot;Enter &#39;higher&#39;, &#39;lower&#39;, or &#39;yes&#39;: &quot;) # conditional statements to check target number and guess if response == &#39;yes&#39;: print(f&quot;I guessed your number {guess}!&quot;) break elif response == &#39;higher&#39;: low = guess + 1 elif response == &#39;lower&#39;: high = guess - 1 else: print(&quot;Invalid input, please enter &#39;higher&#39;, &#39;lower&#39;, or &#39;yes&#39;.&quot;) binary_search_game() . Is your number 50? Enter &#39;higher&#39;, &#39;lower&#39;, or &#39;yes&#39;: lower Is your number 25? Enter &#39;higher&#39;, &#39;lower&#39;, or &#39;yes&#39;: lower Is your number 12? Enter &#39;higher&#39;, &#39;lower&#39;, or &#39;yes&#39;: lower Is your number 6? Enter &#39;higher&#39;, &#39;lower&#39;, or &#39;yes&#39;: lower Is your number 3? Enter &#39;higher&#39;, &#39;lower&#39;, or &#39;yes&#39;: lower Is your number 1? Enter &#39;higher&#39;, &#39;lower&#39;, or &#39;yes&#39;: lower Is your number 0? Enter &#39;higher&#39;, &#39;lower&#39;, or &#39;yes&#39;: lower Is your number 0? Enter &#39;higher&#39;, &#39;lower&#39;, or &#39;yes&#39;: yes I guessed your number 0! . Quick Hack . Write a program using conditionals and nested conditionals . Ideas: Quiz, game (rock paper scissors, guess number), etc | . import random choices = [&quot;rock&quot;, &quot;paper&quot;, &quot;scissors&quot;] print(&quot;Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!&quot;) play_again = &quot;yes&quot; while play_again.lower() == &quot;yes&quot;: player_choice = input(&quot;Choose your weapon (rock, paper, or scissors): &quot;).lower() computer_choice = random.choice(choices) if player_choice == computer_choice: if True: result = &quot;tie&quot; elif (player_choice == &quot;rock&quot; and computer_choice == &quot;scissors&quot;) or (player_choice == &quot;paper&quot; and computer_choice == &quot;rock&quot;) or (player_choice == &quot;scissors&quot; and computer_choice == &quot;paper&quot;): result = &quot;win&quot; else: result = &quot;lose&quot; print(f&quot;You chose {player_choice}. The computer chose {computer_choice}. You {result}!&quot;) play_again = input(&quot;Do you want to play again? (yes or no): &quot;) print(&quot;Thanks for playing!&quot;) . Introduction to Algorithms . an algorithm is a set of instructions that describes how to solve a problem or perform a specific task using a computer program. | It is a precise sequence of computational steps that take an input and produce an output | . How do Algorithms relate to data structures? . Algorithms often rely on specific data structures to solve problems efficiently. | Sorting algorithms require a data structure such as an array or a linked list to store and manipulate data. | Searching algorithms such as binary search require data structures like arrays or trees to organize and search through data. | . Important Terms . What is an algorithm? . it is a finite set of instructions that accomplishes a specific task | . Sequencing . means that there is an order in which to do things | . Selection . Helps to choose two different outcomes based off of a decision that the programmer wants to make | . Iteration . Repeat something until the condition is met. (also referred to as repetition) | . Calling and Developing Procedures . A procedure is a sequence of instructions that performs a specific task. | To call a procedure, you need to know its name and any arguments it requires. | When a procedure is called, the program jumps to its instruction and starts executing it. | The arguments passed to a procedure can be used within the procedure to perform tasks or calculations. | After the procedure has completed its task, it returns control back to the calling program. | . def add_numbers(a, b): sum = a + b print(&quot;The sum of&quot;, a, &quot;and&quot;, b, &quot;is&quot;, sum) # Call the procedure with arguments 5 and 7 add_numbers(5, 7) . The sum of 5 and 7 is 12 . The result of the procedure can be stored in a variable, printed to the screen, or used in any other way that is required by the program. | Procedures can be defined within the same program or in external files, and can be reused across multiple parts of the program. | To avoid errors and improve code readability, it&#39;s important to define and call procedures with proper syntax and conventions that are appropriate for the programming language you&#39;re using. | . def calculate_average(numbers): total = sum(numbers) count = len(numbers) average = total / count return average # Call the procedure with a list of numbers numbers_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] result = calculate_average(numbers_list) # Display the result print(&quot;The average of&quot;, numbers_list, &quot;is&quot;, result) . The average of [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] is 30.0 . Algorithmic Efficiency . Algorithmic efficiency refers to the amount of time and resources needed to execute an algorithm. | The efficiency of an algorithm can be measured in terms of its time complexity and space complexity. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to complete its task as a function of its input size. | Space complexity refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm to complete its task as a function of its input size. | can be analyzed using Big O notation, which provides an upper bound on the worst-case time and space complexity of the algorithm. | . | . What is the time complexity of the following code: . - O(N) - O(N*log(N)) - O(N * Sqrt(N)) - O(N*N) . O(NN) because it is iterating N times for N possibilites, which gives it a time complexity equivalent to NN . a = 0 for i in range(N): for j in reversed(range(i, N)): a = a + i + j . What will be the time complexity of the following code? . n | (n+1) | n(n-1) | n(n+1) | . n(n-1) because it is iterating n times for n-1 possibilities, which gives it a time complexity of n(n-1) . value = 0 for i in range(n): #iterates &quot;n&quot; times, with &quot;i&quot; taking on values from 0 to n-1. for j in range(i): # iterates &quot;i&quot; times, with &quot;j&quot; taking on values from 0 to i-1. value=value+1 . Efficiency can be improved by optimizing algorithms or by using more efficient data structures and algorithms. Some common techniques for improving efficiency include reducing the size of input data, caching results, and parallelizing tasks. | Understanding algorithmic efficiency is important in software development, as it can impact the performance of applications and their ability to scale with larger data sets. | . | . Iteration and Simulations . Simulations are models of real-world phenomena or systems that use mathematical algorithms and computer programs simulate the real behavior and aspects of the subject being modeled. . Simulations are most often used to model complex or time-consuming things that would be difficult to test in real life, such as modeling the spread of diseases in certain ecosystems or testing the functionality of a potential product before it is made. . In this lesson, we will be looking at lists, iteration, and random values through the lens of simulations. . Make sure to run the code segment in the student copy! . Review: Lists and Iteration . Lists and iteration work hand-in-hand to efficiently process and/or modify multiple values at once. In a card game, for example, lists and iteration are used together frequently to make the game work correctly. . For Loops . For loops are probably the most well-known type of iterative loop used in code. Most of us know about the for variable in list format. . One helpful tool not a lot of people konw about is the enumerate() function. When used in conjunction with a for loop, you can always have access to the index and value of each selected list entry. . numlist = [3, 5, 68, 203] for key, num in enumerate(numlist): print(f&quot;This entry&#39;s index is {str(key)}, but its value is {str(num)}.&quot;) print(f&quot;The difference between the value and the index is {num - key}.&quot;) . This entry&#39;s index is 0, but its value is 3. The difference between the value and the index is 3. This entry&#39;s index is 1, but its value is 5. The difference between the value and the index is 4. This entry&#39;s index is 2, but its value is 68. The difference between the value and the index is 66. This entry&#39;s index is 3, but its value is 203. The difference between the value and the index is 200. . QUESTION: How is the key, num in enumerate(list) format similar to the format used when applying a for loop to a dictionary? . List Comprehension . You may also see for loops used within a list like below. We went over this in class fairly recently. In this case, it is used to show the cards in the hand of a player. . player_hand = [] # the player&#39;s hand is represented as a list # because lists are mutable (can change), they can be added to, like drawing a card # assume the deck below is a a deck of shuffled cards deck = [Card(&quot;Hearts&quot;, 3), Card(&quot;Spades&quot;, 12), Card(&quot;Diamonds&quot;, 11)] def draw_card(hand, deck): hand.append(deck.pop()) #try it out draw_card(player_hand, deck) print([card.show() for card in player_hand]) . Recursive Loops . Recursive loops have you calling one function inside of another. If a function must make some change to a certain value multiple times, it is oftem most efficient to have a function call itself with slightly different arguments like the fibonacci sequence below. . def fibonacci(terms): if terms &lt;= 1: return terms return fibonacci(terms-1) + fibonacci(terms-2) fibonacci(5) . 5 . Nesting Loops . Nesting loops increases the time complexity of the program, but it can be used to do things like make a card deck (see below). . def build(deck): for suit in [&quot;Spades&quot;, &quot;Clubs&quot;, &quot;Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Hearts&quot;]: for val in range(2, 15): #HINT: try replacing this function deck.append(Card(suit, val)) . While Loops . While loops aren&#39;t used in the program, but they offer a different way to repeat a set of instructions in a program. The procedure below the while [condition] line will occur until the condition is made not true. . Student Interation: How could this build function be altered to function with a while loop within it? . def build(deck): for suit in [&quot;Spades&quot;, &quot;Clubs&quot;, &quot;Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Hearts&quot;]: for val in range(2, 15): deck.append(Card(suit, val)) #HINT: you may want to make an incrementing i variable . While loops also alter an alternative way to loop a set of instructions forever, until a precise thing occurs to break the loop. See the code below. . import random i = 0 while True: i += 1 ch = random.randint(1, 11) if ch == 10: print(f&quot;It took {str(i)} random generations to get 10.&quot;) break . It took 3 random generations to get 10. . 30 random generations is a lot more than it would normally take, but it&#39;s important for code to be able to model unlikely, yet possible scenarios. Speaking of random values... . Random Values . Because unpredictable randomness occurs in the real world, it&#39;s important to have a way to represent it. Simulations are able to use randomization, which could be in the form of random number generation or other methods like shuffle. . Card decks are a great example of how random values can be used to represent real-world scenarios. In the card simulation, the random module&#39;s shuffle function is used to quite literally shuffle the deck, seen below. . def shuffle(deck): random.shuffle(deck) . Often, random selection methods use functions like randint or randrange as ways to select certain indexes in lists, or might use the random numbers in some other way. . Without shuffling the card order of the deck, can you think of a way that the aforementioned random module functions could be used to get a random card from the deck? . Simulation Homework . Now that you&#39;ve learned about simulations and how they&#39;re used, it&#39;s time to apply that knowledge by creating a (basic) simulation of a real-world scenario. It can be something in nature, like the changes in the wildlife population of a certain area; it can be a game, like Uno (no blackjack though, that&#39;s taken); or it can be something completely random and unique. . The simulation must include... . Use of at least one random value | At least one list or similar data type (dictionary, set, etc.) | Efficient use of iteration (must support the purpose of the simualtion) | Selection (use of conditionals) | . Do this in your student copy in the cell provided. This is worth 0.9 out of the 3 possible points. . Databases . We have already gone over databases in this class, but here is a refresher. A databse contains data that&#39;s stored in columns and rows. The information in this database can then be pulled from the database and can be used in a program. . Setting Up the Database . Run the code cell below to prepare SQLite to create the database. If your system is struggling with the flask functions, verify that you&#39;re in the correct Python environment. Normally, in a flask repository like those we used in class, this info would be established in init.py, though db.init_app(app) typically takes place in main.py. REMEMBER: You should only db.init_app(app) ONCE during the process! . from flask import Flask ! pip install flask_sqlalchemy from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy # Setup of key Flask object (app) app = Flask(__name__) # Setup SQLAlchemy object and properties for the database (db) database = &#39;sqlite:///sqlite.db&#39; # path and filename of database app.config[&#39;SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS&#39;] = False app.config[&#39;SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI&#39;] = database app.config[&#39;SECRET_KEY&#39;] = &#39;SECRET_KEY&#39; db = SQLAlchemy() # This belongs in place where it runs once per project db.init_app(app) .

The Model File . The model file plays a crucial role in the formation of the database. . The model helps to create new databases | It provides a standardized method for formating the database entries across different systems | Objects used within the database are created | . import os, base64 import json from sqlalchemy.exc import IntegrityError # Define the User class to manage actions in the &#39;users&#39; table class User(db.Model): __tablename__ = &#39;players&#39; # table name is plural, class name is singular # Define the User schema with &quot;vars&quot; from object id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True) _username = db.Column(db.String(255), unique=False, nullable=False) _streak = db.Column(db.Integer, unique=True, nullable=False) # constructor of a User object, initializes the instance variables within object (self) def __init__(self, username, streak): self._username = username self._streak = streak # a username getter method, extracts username from object @property def username(self): return self._username # a setter function, allows username to be updated after initial object creation @username.setter def username(self, username): self._username = username # a getter method, extracts streak from object @property def streak(self): return self._streak # a setter function, allows streak to be updated after initial object creation @streak.setter def streak(self, streak): self._streak = streak # output content using str(object) in human readable form, uses getter # output content using json dumps, this is ready for API response def __str__(self): return json.dumps(self.read()) # CRUD create/add a new record to the table # returns self or None on error def create(self): try: # creates a person object from User(db.Model) class, passes initializers db.session.add(self) # add prepares to persist person object to Users table db.session.commit() # SqlAlchemy &quot;unit of work pattern&quot; requires a manual commit return self except IntegrityError: db.session.remove() return None # CRUD read converts self to dictionary # returns dictionary def read(self): return { &quot;id&quot;: self.id, &quot;username&quot;: self.username, &quot;streak&quot;: self.streak } # CRUD update: updates user name, password, phone # returns self def update(self, username, streak): &quot;&quot;&quot;only updates values with length&quot;&quot;&quot; if len(username) &gt; 0: self.username = username if streak &gt; 0: self.streak = streak db.session.commit() return self # CRUD delete: remove self # None def delete(self): db.session.delete(self) db.session.commit() return None &quot;&quot;&quot;Database Creation and Testing &quot;&quot;&quot; # Builds working data for testing def initUsers(): with app.app_context(): &quot;&quot;&quot;Create database and tables&quot;&quot;&quot; db.create_all() &quot;&quot;&quot;Tester data for table&quot;&quot;&quot; u1 = User(username=&quot;Mr. Cards&quot;, streak=5) u2 = User(username=&quot;Kard Kowntre&quot;, streak=10) u3 = User(username=&quot;Un Bea Table&quot;, streak=15) users = [u1, u2, u3] &quot;&quot;&quot;Builds sample user/note(s) data&quot;&quot;&quot; for user in users: try: user.create() print(f&#39;Created user with username &quot;{user.username}&quot;.&#39;) except IntegrityError: &#39;&#39;&#39;fails with bad or duplicate data&#39;&#39;&#39; db.session.remove() print(f&quot;Records exist, duplicate email, or error: {user.username}&quot;) . The init Fuction . The init method has one purpose which is to initialize the object&#39;s attributes. This is what is known as the constructor. In our project, the init method initalizes the username and streak as variables. . def __init__(self, username, streak): self._username = username self._score = streak . Setters and Getters . Setters and Getters are important methods used when writing code for databases. . Setter: a method that allows us to set or change the value of an attribute in a class. | Getter: a method that allows us to access an attribute in a given class. | . Setter Example . @streak.setter def streak(self, streak): self._streak = streak . Getter Example . @property def streak(self): return self._streak . The Api File .

After generation, in the file sqlite.db in the instances folder, you should see a table called &quot;players&quot; that looks like this: . Make sure that the data forms completely and correctly. An Alternative Method of Making SQLite Databases . In a previous lesson, we went over using the cursor object in SQLite3. Rather than go over all of that here, this lesson goes over it thoroughly. (You may use this method for the homework below.) . Database Homework . For this assignment, we&#39;d like you to make your own database file as instructed above. Remember, the API file isn&#39;t necessary in this case; you&#39;ll be focusing on making the model and the init function. . Your database must include these things: . A class with at least four attributes (if not the cursor method) | Setters and getters for this class (if not the cursor method) | Each of the CRUD functions | An init function with at least four entries | A screenshot showing proof that your SQLite file has been created correctly | . Feel free to base your database on the model provided above! Ask our group if you have any questions or concerns. . # If you&#39;ve already run the db.init_app(app) function while in this notebook, # don&#39;t do it again until you&#39;ve closed it! . Grading . Your submission will be graded based on the following criteria: . Filling in the blank throughout the lesson and providing code in the given cells when applicable (0.9) | Simulation homework (0.9) | Database homework (0.9) | . Here are some ideas for ways to increase your score above a 2.7: . Make a frontend version of your simulation that can be interacted with on your blog | Connect your simulation to the database you create | Create a menu that allows a user to make an entry in your database (CRUD functions within it) | You can establish a relationship between two classes/tables in your database (see the relationship between the User and Note classes in the Nighthawk Coders flask repository) | .

Predictive analysis is the use of statistical, data mining, and machine learning techniques to analyze current and historical data in order to make predictions about future events or behaviors. It involves identifying patterns and trends in data, and then using that information to forecast what is likely to happen in the future. . Predictive analysis is used in a wide range of applications, from forecasting sales and demand, to predicting customer behavior, to detecting fraudulent transactions. It involves collecting and analyzing data from a variety of sources, including historical data, customer data, financial data, and social media data, among others. . The process of predictive analysis typically involves the following steps: . Defining the problem and identifying the relevant data sources | Collecting and cleaning the data | Exploring and analyzing the data to identify patterns and trends | Selecting an appropriate model or algorithm to use for predictions | Training and validating the model using historical data | Using the model to make predictions on new data | Monitoring and evaluating the performance of the model over time | Predictive analysis can help organizations make more informed decisions, improve efficiency, and gain a competitive advantage by leveraging insights from data. . It is most commonly used in Retail, where workers try to predict which products would be most popular and try to advertise those products as much as possible, and also Healthcare, where algorithms analyze patterns and reveal prerequisites for diseases and suggest preventive treatment, predict the results of various treatments and choose the best option for each patient individually, and predict disease outbreaks and epidemics. . 1. Intro to NumPy and the features it consists . Numpy, by definition, is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python which can be used to perform mathematical operations, providing multidimensional array objects, and makes data analysis much easier. Numpy is very important and useful when it comes to data analysis, as it can easily use its features to complete and perform any mathematical operation, as well as analyze data files. . If you don&#39;t already have numpy installed, you can do so using conda install numpy or pip install numpy . Once that is complete, to import numpy in your code, all you must do is: . import numpy as np . 2. Using NumPy to create arrays . An array is the central data structure of the NumPy library. They are used as containers which are able to store more than one item at the same time. Using the function np.array is used to create an array, in which you can create multidimensional arrays. . Shown below is how to create a 1D array: . a = np.array([1, 2, 3]) print(a) # this creates a 1D array . [1 2 3] . How could you create a 3D array based on knowing how to make a 1D array? . arr1d = np.arange(27) # reshape the 1D array into a 3D array arr3d = arr1d.reshape((3, 3, 3)) print(arr3d) . [[[ 0 1 2] [ 3 4 5] [ 6 7 8]] [[ 9 10 11] [12 13 14] [15 16 17]] [[18 19 20] [21 22 23] [24 25 26]]] . Arrays can be printed in different ways, especially a more readable format. As we have seen, arrays are printed in rows and columns, but we can change that by using the reshape function . c = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]) print(c.reshape(1, 9)) # organizes it all in a single line of output . [[1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]] . In the code segment below, we can also specially select certain rows and columns from the array to further analyze selective data. . print(c[1:, :2]) # the 1: means &quot;start at row 1 and select all the remaining rows&quot; # the :2 means &quot;select the first two columns&quot; . [[4 5] [7 8]] . 3. Basic array operations . One of the most basic operations that can be performed on arrays is arithmetic operations. With numpy, it is very easy to perform arithmetic operations on arrays. You can add, subtract, multiply and divide arrays, just like you would with regular numbers. When performing these operations, numpy applies the operation element-wise, meaning that it performs the operation on each element in the array separately. This makes it easy to perform operations on large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. . a = np.array([1, 2, 3]) b = np.array([4, 5, 6]) print(a + b) # adds each value based on the column the integer is in print(a - b) # subtracts each value based on the column the integer is in print(a * b) # multiplies each value based on the column the integer is in print(a / b) # divides each value based on the column the integer is in .

[0.84147098 0.90929743 0.14112001] . 4. Data analysis using numpy . Numpy provides a convenient and powerful way to perform data analysis tasks on large datasets. One of the most common tasks in data analysis is finding the mean, median, and standard deviation of a dataset. Numpy provides functions to perform these operations quickly and easily. The mean function calculates the average value of the data, while the median function calculates the middle value in the data. The standard deviation function calculates how spread out the data is from the mean. Additionally, numpy provides functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the data. These functions are very useful for gaining insight into the properties of large datasets and can be used for a wide range of data analysis tasks. . data = np.array([2, 5, 12, 13, 19]) print(np.mean(data)) # finds the mean of the dataset print(np.median(data)) # finds the median of the dataset print(np.std(data)) # finds the standard deviation of the dataset print(np.min(data)) # finds the min of the dataset print(np.max(data)) # finds the max of the dataset . 10.2 12.0 6.04648658313239 2 19 . Now from learning this, can you find a different way from how we can solve the sum or products of a dataset other than how we learned before? . print(np.sum(data)) print(np.prod(data)) . 51 29640 . Numpy also has the ability to handle CSV files, which are commonly used to store and exchange large datasets. By importing CSV files into numpy arrays, we can easily perform complex operations and analysis on the data, making numpy an essential tool for data scientists and researchers. . genfromtxt and loadtxt are two functions in the numpy library that can be used to read data from text files, including CSV files. . genfromtxt is a more advanced function that can be used to read text files that have more complex structures, including CSV files. genfromtxt can handle files that have missing or invalid data, or files that have columns of different data types. It can also be used to skip header lines or to read only specific columns from the file. . import numpy as np import requests url = &#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paravsalaniwal/T3Project/master/_notebooks/files/padres.csv&#39; response = requests.get(url) if response.status_code == 200: with open(&#39;padres.csv&#39;, &#39;wb&#39;) as f: f.write(response.content) print(&#39;File downloaded successfully&#39;) else: print(&#39;Error downloading file&#39;) padres = np.genfromtxt(&#39;padres.csv&#39;, delimiter=&#39;,&#39;, dtype=str, encoding=&#39;utf-8&#39;) # delimiter indicates that the data is separated into columns which is distinguished by commas # genfromtxt is used to read the csv file itself # dtype is used to have numpy automatically detect the data type in the csv file print(padres) .

Pandas . What is Pandas . Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets. A python library is something It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data. . Why Use Pandas? . Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories. Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant. Also it is a part of data analysis, and data manipulation. . What Can Pandas Do? . Pandas gives you answers about the data. Like: . Is there a correlation between two or more columns? | What is average value | Max value | Min value | How to load data | Delete data | Sort Data. | . Pandas are also able to delete rows that are not relevant, or contains wrong values, like empty or NULL values. This is called cleaning the data. . Basics of Pandas. . import pandas as pd # What this does is it calls the python pandas library and this code segment is needed whenever incorporating pandas. . DICTIONARIES AND DATASETS . One way you are able to manipulate a pandas data set is by creating a dictionary and calling it as seen with the dict data 1 and pd.dataframe which is a way to print the set. | . import pandas as pd data1 = { &#39;teams&#39;: [&quot;BARCA&quot;, &quot;REAL&quot;, &quot;ATLETICO&quot;], &#39;standings&#39;: [1, 2, 3] } myvar = pd.DataFrame(data1) print(myvar) . teams standings 0 BARCA 1 1 REAL 2 2 ATLETICO 3 . Indexing and manipulaton of data through lists. . With pandas you can also organize the data which is one of its biggest perks, we call this indexing, this is when we define the first column in a data frame. | . import pandas as pd score = [5/5, 5/5, 1/5] myvar = pd.Series(score, index = [&quot;math&quot;, &quot;science&quot;, &quot;pe&quot;]) print(myvar) . math 1.0 science 1.0 pe 0.2 dtype: float64 . Pandas Classes . Within pandas the library consits of a lot of functions which allow you to manipulate datasets in lists dictionsaries and csv files here are some of the ones we are going to cover (hint: take notes on these) . Series | Index | PeriodIndex | DataframeGroupedBy | Categorical | Time Stamp | . PeriodIndex . This allows for a way to repeat data over time that it occurs as seen from january 2022 to december 2023. You can use Y for years, M for months, and D for days. | . import pandas as pd time = pd.period_range(&#39;2022-01&#39;, &#39;2022-12&#39;, freq=&#39;M&#39;) print(time) . PeriodIndex([&#39;2022-01&#39;, &#39;2022-02&#39;, &#39;2022-03&#39;, &#39;2022-04&#39;, &#39;2022-05&#39;, &#39;2022-06&#39;, &#39;2022-07&#39;, &#39;2022-08&#39;, &#39;2022-09&#39;, &#39;2022-10&#39;, &#39;2022-11&#39;, &#39;2022-12&#39;], dtype=&#39;period[M]&#39;) . Now implement a way to show a period index from June 2022 to July 2023 in days. . time = pd.period_range(&#39;2022-06&#39;, &#39;2023-07&#39;, freq=&#39;M&#39;) print(time) . PeriodIndex([&#39;2022-06&#39;, &#39;2022-07&#39;, &#39;2022-08&#39;, &#39;2022-09&#39;, &#39;2022-10&#39;, &#39;2022-11&#39;, &#39;2022-12&#39;, &#39;2023-01&#39;, &#39;2023-02&#39;, &#39;2023-03&#39;, &#39;2023-04&#39;, &#39;2023-05&#39;, &#39;2023-06&#39;, &#39;2023-07&#39;], dtype=&#39;period[M]&#39;) . Dataframe Grouped By . This allows for you to organize your data and calculate the different functions such as | count(): returns the number of non-null values in each group. | sum(): returns the sum of values in each group. | mean(): returns the mean of values in each group. | min(): returns the minimum value in each group. | max(): returns the maximum value in each group. | median(): returns the median of values in each group. | var(): returns the variance of values in each group. | agg(): applies one or more functions to each group and returns a new DataFrame with the results. | . import pandas as pd data = { &#39;Category&#39;: [&#39;E&#39;, &#39;F&#39;, &#39;E&#39;, &#39;F&#39;, &#39;E&#39;, &#39;F&#39;, &#39;E&#39;, &#39;F&#39;], &#39;Value&#39;: [100, 250, 156, 255, 240, 303, 253, 3014] } df = pd.DataFrame(data) grouped = df.groupby(&#39;Category&#39;)#GUESS WHAT THIS WOULD BE IF WE WERE LOOKING FOR COMBINED TOTALS!() print(grouped) . &lt;pandas.core.groupby.generic.DataFrameGroupBy object at 0x7f656639e830&gt; . Categorical . This sets up a category for something and puts it within the categories and allows for better orginzation | . import pandas as pd colors = pd.Categorical([&#39;yellow&#39;, &#39;orange&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;, &#39;yellow&#39;, &#39;orange&#39;], categories=[&#39;yellow&#39;, &#39;orange&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;]) print(colors) .

It is a __ language that is _ into CSS, which means that __, which is what your web browser can read. . SASS vs SCSS . As you learn about Sass, you might notice something called Scss. They are basically the same thing except that Scss uses curly braces and semicolons to distinguish between lines. Sass uses indentation and newlines instead. . We will be teaching the Scss syntax because it is more commonly used. . Getting started . A easy way to write SASS and have it preprocessed into CSS is by using a Jekyll powered website, such as GitHub pages or Fastpages. . The first step is to clone a GitHub pages repo, such as this one. . Within the repository, head over to assets/css/, and open style.scss. . This is where you can create your SASS code. . To see your CSS-translated SASS code, head over to _site/assets/css/style.css . Note: You will need to run bundle exec jekyll serve before the _site directory appears. . The first few hundred lines are used to style Github&#39;s theme. Make sure to scroll to the very bottom to see the SASS code that you wrote, which is in the form of CSS. . Nesting . Take notes here . Mini-hack . Write out the SASS equivalent for the following CSS code: . .a .b { color: green; } .a .c { color: blue; } . Extend/Inheritance . What are some similarities that the buttons share? What are the differences? . Take notes here . Mixin . Take notes here . Mini-hack . Write out a mixin in SASS that takes in a color and a font size as the parameter. Within the mixin, set the background color and font color to the color parameter, and set the font size to the font size parameter. Then create a selector that calls the mixin, and pass in a color and font size of your choice as the arguments. . Function . Take notes here . Import . Take notes here . SASS Hacks .

In the bullet points below, record 5 things that you already knew about binary before this lecture . binary is composed of 1s and 0s | binary is represented as a series of integers | binary is readable by computers | binary helps computers compile code | most applications use binary | . Binary is can be applied in many ways to store, access, and manipulate information. Think of three applications that rely on binary. . VS Code | Anaconda | Docker | . Why is binary such an effective system for storing information? Why don&#39;t computers use the decimal system instead? . Binary is an effective system for storing information in computers because it only has two digits, 0 and 1, which can be easily represented by the on and off states of electronic switches. Using decimal system in computers would be inefficient due to the requirement of multiple states, leading to more complex hardware and slower processing. . Bitwise Opperations . Fill in the blank spots below during the lecture . Opearator Name Action . &amp; | AND | | . | OR | | . ^ | XOR | | . ~ | NOT | | . &lt;&lt; | Left Shift | | . &gt;&gt; | Right Shift | | . &gt;&gt;&gt; | Zero-fill Right Shift | | . In this program, the &amp; (AND), | (OR), ^ (XOR), and ~ (NOT) are used to perform the binary operations on the input numbers. The results are stored in separate variables as integers. Then, the binary_operations function is used to convert each decimal result to binary, and the binary strings are stored in separate variables. Finally, the program returns a tuple of tuples, with each inner tuple containing both the decimal and binary result for each operation. The outer tuple is converted into separate variables for printing, and the results are displayed as both decimal and binary. . def binary_operations(num1, num2): # Perform the binary operations and_result_decimal = num1 &amp; num2 or_result_decimal = num1 | num2 xor_result_decimal = num1 ^ num2 not_result_decimal = ~num1 # Convert results to binary and_result_binary = bin(and_result_decimal)[2:] or_result_binary = bin(or_result_decimal)[2:] xor_result_binary = bin(xor_result_decimal)[2:] not_result_binary = bin(not_result_decimal)[2:] # Return the results as a tuple of tuples return ((and_result_decimal, and_result_binary), (or_result_decimal, or_result_binary), (xor_result_decimal, xor_result_binary), (not_result_decimal, not_result_binary)) # Ask the user for input num1 = int(input(&quot;Enter the first number: &quot;)) num2 = int(input(&quot;Enter the second number: &quot;)) # Call the binary_operations function and print the results and_result, or_result, xor_result, not_result = binary_operations(num1, num2) print(&quot;AND result: decimal =&quot;, and_result[0], &quot;, binary =&quot;, and_result[1]) print(&quot;OR result: decimal =&quot;, or_result[0], &quot;, binary =&quot;, or_result[1]) print(&quot;XOR result: decimal =&quot;, xor_result[0], &quot;, binary =&quot;, xor_result[1]) print(&quot;NOT result: decimal =&quot;, not_result[0], &quot;, binary =&quot;, not_result[1]) . AND result: decimal = 2 , binary = 10 OR result: decimal = 58 , binary = 111010 XOR result: decimal = 56 , binary = 111000 NOT result: decimal = -11 , binary = b1011 . Bitwise operations are used in a variety of applications, particularly in low-level programming and computer science. Some common used of bitwise operations include:&gt; - Flag Management: Flags are used to keep track of the state or status of a process or data. Bitwise operations can be used to set, clear, and toggle flags.&gt; - Bit Manipulation:Bitwise operations can be used to manipulate individual bits in a binary number. This is often used to extract specific bits from a number, set specific bits to a particular value, or flip the value of specific bits.&gt; - Masking:Masking is used to extract a specific range of bits from a binary number. Bitwise operations are commonly used for masking, particularly in low-level programming.&gt; - Encryption:Bitwise operations can be used in cryptographic applications to scramble and unscramble data. One common application of bitwise operations in encryption is the XOR operation.&gt; - Graphics:Bitwise operations can be used in computer graphics to manipulate individual pixels on a screen. This can be used to draw shapes, change colors, and create special effects.&gt; - Networking:Bitwise operations are used extensively in networking applications, particularly in the handling of IP addresses and port numbers. . Binary to String Conversion . This program defines a string_to_binary function that takes a string as input and returns the binary representation of the string. The function uses a for loop to iterate over each character in the string. For each character, the ord function is used to get its ASCII code, which is then converted to binary using the format function with the &#39;08b&#39; format specifier to ensure that each binary number is 8 digits long. The resulting binary numbers are concatenated to form the final binary string. . . # Function to convert a string to binary def string_to_binary(string): binary = &#39;&#39; for char in string: binary += format(ord(char), &#39;08b&#39;) # Convert the character to binary and append to the binary string return binary # Example usage word = input(&quot;Enter a word to convert to binary: &quot;) binary_word = string_to_binary(word) print(f&quot;The binary representation of &#39;{word}&#39; is {binary_word}&quot;) . The binary representation of &#39;word&#39; is 01110111011011110111001001100100 . Many programs use binary conversion, particularly those related to computer science, electrical engineering, and mathematics. Programs that rely on binary conversion include:&gt; - Networking: Programs that deal with network addresses, such as IP addresses and subnet masks, use binary conversion to represent and manipulate the addresses.&gt; - Cryptography:Programs that deal with encryption and decryption use binary conversion to encode and decode data.&gt; - Computer Hardware:Programs that interface with computer hardware, such as drivers and firmware, often use binary conversion to communicate with the hardware at the binary level.&gt; - Mathematical Applications:Programs that deal with complex calculations and mathematical analysis, such as statistical analysis or machine learning algorithms, may use binary conversion to represent large numbers or complex data sets.&gt; - Finance:Programs that deal with financial calculations and accounting may use binary conversion to represent fractional amounts or complex financial data. .

(0.9) . | . Applying Binary Math - Calculator Hack . Calculators use binary math to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.In a calculator, the binary digits are represented by electronic switches that can be either on or off, corresponding to 1 or 0 respectively. These switches are arranged in groups of eight to form bytes, which are used to represent larger numbers. When a user enters a number into a calculator, the number is converted into binary form and stored in the calculator&#39;s memory.To perform an arithmetic operation, the calculator retrieves the numbers from its memory and performs the operation using binary math. . For example, to add the binary numbers 1010 and 1101, the calculator would perform the following steps:&gt; 1. Add the rightmost digits, 0 and 1, which gives a sum of 1.&gt; 2. Move to the next digit to the left and add the digits along with any carry from the previous step. In this case, we have 1 + 0 + 1, which gives a sum of 10. The carry of 1 is then carried over to the next digit. . Repeat step 2 for the remaining digits until all digits have been added. | The result of the addition in this example is the binary number 10111, which is equivalent to the decimal number 23. | Similarly, subtraction, multiplication, and division are performed using binary math. The algorithms for these operations are based on the same principles as those used in decimal arithmetic, but with binary digits and powers of 2 instead of decimal digits and powers of 10. . def binary_math(num1, num2, operator): def binary_addition(a, b): result = &#39;&#39; carry = 0 while a or b: sum = carry if a: sum += int(a[-1]) a = a[:-1] if b: sum += int(b[-1]) b = b[:-1] carry = sum // 2 result += str(sum % 2) if carry: result += str(carry) return result[::-1] def binary_subtraction(a, b): result = &#39;&#39; borrow = 0 while a or b: sub = borrow if a: sub += int(a[-1]) a = a[:-1] if b: sub -= int(b[-1]) b = b[:-1] if sub &lt; 0: sub += 2 borrow = -1 else: borrow = 0 result += str(sub) return result[::-1].lstrip(&#39;0&#39;) def binary_multiplication(a, b): result = &#39;0&#39; shift = 0 for digit in reversed(b): if digit == &#39;1&#39;: temp_a = a + &#39;0&#39; * shift result = binary_addition(result, temp_a) shift += 1 return result def binary_division(a, b): quotient = &#39;&#39; remainder = &#39;&#39; for digit in a: remainder += digit if int(remainder, 2) &gt;= int(b, 2): quotient += &#39;1&#39; remainder = binary_subtraction(remainder, b) else: quotient += &#39;0&#39; return quotient.lstrip(&#39;0&#39;), remainder.lstrip(&#39;0&#39;) bin_num1 = bin(num1)[2:] bin_num2 = bin(num2)[2:] # Perform operation if operator == &quot;+&quot;: result_bin = binary_addition(bin_num1, bin_num2) elif operator == &quot;-&quot;: result_bin = binary_subtraction(bin_num1, bin_num2) elif operator == &quot;*&quot;: result_bin = binary_multiplication(bin_num1, bin_num2) elif operator == &quot;/&quot;: quotient_bin, remainder_bin = binary_division(bin_num1, bin_num2) else: print(&quot;Invalid operation&quot;) # Convert result to decimal if operator == &quot;/&quot;: quotient_dec = int(quotient_bin, 2) remainder_dec = int(remainder_bin, 2) print(f&quot;The quotient is: {quotient_dec}&quot;) print(f&quot;The remainder is: {remainder_dec}&quot;) else: result_dec = int(result_bin, 2) print(f&quot;Final int: {result_dec}&quot;) # Ask the user for input num1 = int(input(&quot;Enter the first number: &quot;)) num2 = int(input(&quot;Enter the second number: &quot;)) operator = input(&quot;Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): &quot;) # Call the binary_math function and print the result result = binary_math(num1, num2, operator) .

            "content": "Results: . I scored a 61/67, or 91%. I got 6 questions wrong, which I will go over below. . Corrections: . Question 4: . Answer choice D, which states that “the program cannot represent integers; the integers are converted into decimal approximations, leading to rounding errors”, is incorrect because while fractions are sometimes represented by decimal approximations that are subject to rounding errors, integers are not. Answer choice C, which states that “the program can only use a fixed number of bits to represent integers; the computed sum is greater than the maximum representable value”, is correct because overflow errors occur when an arithmetic operation results in a value outside the range of numbers that can be represented by a fixed number of bits. . Question 6: . Answer choice D, which states that neither program I nor program II correctly moves the robot to the gray square, is incorrect because program I correctly moves the robot to the gray square by repeatedly moving the robot forward, rotating left, moving forward twice, and rotating right. Program II correctly moves the robot to the gray square by moving the robot forward to the bottom right corner of the grid, rotating left, moving the robot forward to the upper right corner of the grid, rotating left, and moving forward to the gray square. Answer choice C, which states that both program I and program II correctly move the robot to the gray square, is correct because Program I correctly moves the robot to the gray square by repeatedly moving the robot forward, rotating left, moving forward twice, and rotating right. Program II correctly moves the robot to the gray square by moving the robot forward to the bottom right corner of the grid, rotating left, moving the robot forward to the upper right corner of the grid, rotating left, and moving forward to the gray square. . Question 10: . Answer choice D is incorrect because this code segment initially sets cost to 6, then increases cost by 2 for people who are either going on a guided tour or whose age is greater than 12. Because of the ELSE statement, the cost is not properly set for people who are both older than 12 and going on a guided tour. Answer choice B is correct because this code segment initially sets cost to 6 (the cheapest possible ticket price), then increases cost by 2 for people whose age is greater than 12. Regardless of the person’s age, cost is increased by 2 for people going on a guided tour. . Question 15: . Answer choice C, which states that Program A and program B display the same number of values, but the values differ, is incorrect because while the two programs initialize i to different values, the same values are printed inside the loop because program A prints i and then increments it and program B increments i and then prints it. Answer choice A, which Program A and program B display identical values in the same order, is correct because Program A initializes i to 1. Inside the loop, it prints i and then increments i. The loop terminates when i is greater than 10, which occurs after 10 is printed. Program A prints 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. Program B initializes i to 0. Inside the loop, it increments i and then prints i. The loop terminates when i equals 10, which occurs after 10 is printed. Program B prints 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. . Question 36: . Answer choice B, which states that the updated model is likely to decrease the runtime of the simulation because simulations that use older models tend to require more time to run than simulations that use newer models, is incorrect because whether the model is older or newer is not related to the amount of time it will take to run a simulation. Answer choice A, which states that the updated model is likely to decrease the runtime of the simulation because the time required for simulations generally depends on the complexity of the model used, is correct because the time required for a simulation to run is impacted by the level of detail used in the model. Generally, a simulation based on a less detailed model will require less time to run. . Question 53: . Answer choice A, which states that a mobile application and collar that uses GPS technology to determine the pet’s location and transmits the location when the owner refreshes the application, is incorrect because this system uses GPS technology to find a lost pet, rather than the contributions of many individuals. Answer choice C, which states that a mobile application that allows users to report the location of a pet that appears to be lost and upload a photo that is made available to other users of the application is correct because this system uses an application to enlist the services of a large number of people to help find a lost pet. .",

The “http” layer is an application layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack, used for communication between web browsers and web servers. It is the protocol used for transmitting data over the World Wide Web. . The “transport” layer (TCP) is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications running on different hosts. The TCP protocol segments the data into smaller chunks called “segments”. Each segment contains a sequence number that identifies its position in the original stream of data, as well as other control information such as source and destination port numbers, and checksums for error detection. . The “ip” layer is responsible for packetizing data received from the TCP layer of the protocol stack, and then encapsulating the data into IP packets. The IP packets are then sent to the lower layers of the protocol stack for transmission over the network. . The “network” layer is responsible for routing data packets between networks using the Internet Protocol (IP). This layer handles tasks such as packet addressing and routing, fragmentation and reassembly, and network congestion control. . Fault Tolerance . Watch both Daily videos for 4.2 .

Here are some thoughts to add to your story of Computers and Networks… . load balancing with an API | . What is naturally Distributed in Frontend/Backend architecture? The backend is naturally distributed as it typically consists of multiple servers, each responsible for handling different tasks or services. By distributing the backend, the application can handle a large number of requests, improve performance and reliability, and provide fault tolerance and high availability. The frontend, on the other hand, is typically executed on a single client device, such as a web browser or mobile app, and is responsible for displaying the user interface and interacting with the user. . | Analyze this command in Docker: ENV GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS=&quot;--workers=1 --bind=0.0.0.0:8086&quot;. Determine if there is options are options in this command for parallel computing within the server that runs python/gunicorn. Here is an article . | . In the context of a Docker image that runs a Python/Gunicorn web application, this command is used to configure the Gunicorn web server. The –workers option specifies the number of worker processes that Gunicorn should spawn to handle incoming requests. In this case, the value is set to 1, which means that Gunicorn will use a single worker process to handle all requests. The –bind option specifies the IP address and port number that Gunicorn should bind to, in this case, 0.0.0.0:8086, which means that Gunicorn will listen on all network interfaces on port 8086. . To enable parallel computing in Python/Gunicorn web application, you can adjust the –workers option to a higher value, which will spawn multiple worker processes to handle incoming requests concurrently. However, increasing the number of worker processes may also increase the memory usage and CPU load of the server. . CHALLENGE: seek how many workers I have set up on gunicorn and set up more I think there are currently 4 workers on gunicorn, I can run gunicorn myapp:app -w 8 to set up more. | . Last week we discussed parallel computing on local machine. There are many options. Here is something to get parallel computing work with a tool called Ray. . Review this article… Can you get parallel code on images to work more effectively? I have not tried Ray. Ray is a distributed computing system that makes it easy to write parallel and distributed Python applications. It is designed to be efficient and scalable, and can help you parallelize your code across multiple CPU cores, GPUs, or even multiple machines. | . Code example from ChatGPT using squares.

My answer: (D) 4 . Correct answer: (C) 3 . My answer is incorrect. While removing four links could isolate computer F from computer E, it is not the minimum number required to accomplish this. We could isolate computer F completely by only removing 3 links. . Any line between two computers represents a way for them to communicate with each other, and a communication between two computers can go through other computers. If the links from F to G, from F to A, and from F to E were broken, it would not be possible for computers E and F to communicate. . Q34 . . My answer: (C) Show that for one instance of the problem, a heuristic is needed to write an algorithm that is capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer. . Correct answer: (B) Show that for one instance of the problem, no algorithm can be written that is capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer. . This statement does not provide enough information to conclude that the problem is undecidable. This states that a heuristic is used for one instance of the problem. If it could be shown that an algorithm can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer for all other instances of this problem, then this problem would be decidable. . A decidable problem is one for which an algorithm can be constructed to produce a correct output for all inputs. If, for one instance of the problem, this is not possible, then this problem cannot be decidable. Therefore, it must be undecidable. . Q37 . . My answer: (D) The algorithm runs in an unreasonable amount of time because it will use approximately n^2 steps to draw n shapes. . Correct answer: (B) The algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time because it will use approximately n^2 steps to draw n shapes. . It is correct that as n increases, the number of steps is approximately equal to n^2. However, that means the algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time. . As n increases, the number of steps is approximately equal to n^2, which would make the algorithm polynomial. An algorithm with an efficiency that approximates n^2 is said to run in a reasonable amount of time. . Q49 . . My answer: (C) . Correct answer: (A) . This code segment traverses the list beginning with the second element, so it is correctly comparing only the student scores to the maximum possible score. However, the code segment will fail to check the last element in the list. When index is equal to the length of the list, the loop will terminate without comparing the last student score in the list to the maximum possible score. . The correct code segment traverses the list beginning with the second element, so it is correctly comparing only student scores to the maximum possible score, which is found by accessing scores[1]. The variable found will only be set to true when a student’s score equals the maximum possible score. The code also sets the number of iterations to LENGTH(scores) - 1 to reflect that the first list element (maximum score) is skipped. .",

            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is constant. | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # First three numbers in the set list are printed # Output of all numbers in the list without any duplicates # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # Both can&#39;t have any duplicates. # Both store data . {1, 2, 3} .

            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is constant. | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # # It doesn&#39;t output the repeated numbers (Only outputs one of each) # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # # Both will always contain unique values (It disregards the duplicate items) . {1, 2, 3} . Dictionary Example . Below are just some basic features of a dictionary. As always, documentation is always the main source for all the full capablilties. . lover_album = { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Lover&quot;, &quot;artist&quot;: &quot;Taylor Swift&quot;, &quot;year&quot;: 2019, &quot;genre&quot;: [&quot;Pop&quot;, &quot;Synth-pop&quot;], &quot;tracks&quot;: { 1: &quot;I Forgot That You Existed&quot;, 2: &quot;Cruel Summer&quot;, 3: &quot;Lover&quot;, 4: &quot;The Man&quot;, 5: &quot;The Archer&quot;, 6: &quot;I Think He Knows&quot;, 7: &quot;Miss Americana &amp; The Heartbreak Prince&quot;, 8: &quot;Paper Rings&quot;, 9: &quot;Cornelia Street&quot;, 10: &quot;Death By A Thousand Cuts&quot;, 11: &quot;London Boy&quot;, 12: &quot;Soon You&#39;ll Get Better (feat.

            "content": "CSUSM Programs Event . Notes/Insights . Don’t let failures define you, an ambassador spoke on how she failed a lot of classes in college but it didn’t deter her path at all. I thought it was really interesting that she got a D in AP Physics but didn’t care about the grade and only focused on how much she enjoyed learning the subject. It was really inspiring because after I got a B in the second trimester of BC, I thought I wasn’t suited for a career in STEM even though I liked math (and was extremely good at competition math). At the end of the day, if you’re good at a subject but hate it, it’s a lot harder to grow into loving something rather than starting off weaker but building your skill. | Computer science is relevant in every field, ambassador used python even as an applied major to read data for her applied physics labs. | Apply for jobs and internships even if you feel under qualified → you learn by doing, you are going to learn a lot while working in that job. Oftentimes, employers are looking for a strong foundation of basic skills and a combination of soft skills like working well with people, detail orientedness, etc. | Ask faculty and others to look over your work, it is always better to have a second pair of eyes provide feedback as they probably noticed something that you didn’t. This reminded me the importance of showing others my work in computer science, I like to look at other people’s hacks and share my own work with people outside of my group because it inspires me to make changes to my own code. I used to do this a lot in past trimesters, and will try doing it more again. | It seems like the college you attend doesn’t seem to matter as much as I thought it did. In fact, I noticed it’s really hard for some of my friends right now who attend prestigious universities and UC’s to find internships because it’s super competitive and hard to get to know your professor in a big class. CSUSM, although it is a much smaller school, it seems to provide a lot of opportunities and attention for its students.

For question number 2, I chose option choice A, which is “A lossless compression algorithm can guarantee that compressed information is kept secure, while a lossy compression algorithm cannot.”, which is incorrect because the ability to keep data secure is not a primary function of a compression algorithm. Instead, the right answer is option choice B, which is “A lossless compression algorithm can guarantee reconstruction of original data, while a lossy compression algorithm cannot.”, which is correct because lossless compression algorithms are guaranteed to be able to reconstruct the original data, while lossy compression algorithms are not. . Question 21 . For question number 21, I chose option choice C, which is “Sort by subject, then sort by year, then filter by photographer”, which is incorrect because this sequence of steps does not remove any entries with an unknown year, so the entry in the first row of the spreadsheet will have a year value of -1. Instead, the right answer is option choice D, which is “Sort by year, then filter by year, then filter by photographer”, which is correct because sorting by year will sort the spreadsheet on column C from least to greatest. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Since the order of the entries is not affected by the filters, the photograph with the lowest year value will be in the first row of the spreadsheet. .",

Create a new User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL INSERT to add row . Compare create() in both SQL lessons. What is better or worse in the two implementations? The code for this create is much shorter. It requires the conn and cursor objects to be opened and closed. The cursor must execute a code which takes all of the variables and adds it to the table. | . | Explain purpose of SQL INSERT. Is this the same as User init? SQL INSERT allows rows to be added to an SQL database table. The User init function allows a dataset which is defined to be able to added to an SQL database. This serves a similar purpose. | . | . import sqlite3 def create(): name = input(&quot;Enter your name:&quot;) uid = input(&quot;Enter your user id:&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter your password&quot;) dob = input(&quot;Enter your date of birth &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to insert data into a table cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO users (_name, _uid, _password, _dob) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (name, uid, password, dob)) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() print(f&quot;A new user record {uid} has been created&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the INSERT:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #create() . Updating a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL UPDATE to modify password . What does the hacked part do? The hacked part of the update function outputs a message to the user if the length of the password is too short. This serves as authentication for the user to make sure that a password is long enough for security purposes. | . | Explain try/except, when would except occur? Try and except work as things which check if certain code is running/working. Try runs if the code is working smoothly, and in this case serves to update the password. Except occurs if there is an error with the connection and cursor with the database. This serves as a good way to check errors if there is something wrong with the code. | . | What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated? Code that seems to be repeated include import sqlite3, defining the conn and cursor methods, cursor execute, conn.commit(), and conn and cursor close. This code seems to be repeated because it is required to connect and use the cursor method in the database. cursor.execute() seems to run the wanted code, whether it is update, delete, read, etc. conn.commit() appears that it commits the changes to the database in order to make the changes permanent. The closing of cursor and conn appears to be present because it is important be able to close the working connections and cursors in order to be able to have different ones. This is especially important when working with servers because it makes sure to have orderly code and prevents resources from being used unnecessarily. | . | . import sqlite3 def update(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to update&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter updated password&quot;) if len(password) &lt; 2: message = &quot;hacked&quot; password = &#39;gothackednewpassword123&#39; else: message = &quot;successfully updated&quot; # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to update data in a table cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE users SET _password = ? WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (password, uid)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: print(f&quot;The row with user id {uid} the password has been {message}&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the UPDATE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() update() . No uid was not found in the table . Delete a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses a delete function to remove a user based on a user input of the id. . Is DELETE a dangerous operation? Why? DELETE can be a dangerous operation because it can remove information from the database, and if placed in the wrong hands, they could delete important information by accident. However, delete is also necessary in order to maintain a clean database with proper records. | . | In the print statemements, what is the &quot;f&quot; and what does {uid} do? In the print statements, the &quot;f&quot; and {uid} allow the coder to include the selected uid without having to add multiple strings in the print statement. It allows for easy replacement and making a statement which uses the variable which the user called for. | . | . import sqlite3 def delete(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to delete&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM users WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (uid,)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: # The uid was found in the table and the row was deleted print(f&quot;The row with uid {uid} was successfully deleted&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the DELETE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #delete() . Menu Interface to CRUD operations . CRUD and Schema interactions from one location by running menu. Observe input at the top of VSCode, observe output underneath code cell. . Why does the menu repeat? The menu repeats so the user has access to the functions multiple times if they want, instead of having to restart the code cell every time they want to try a new function. | . | Could you refactor this menu? Make it work with a List? This menu could be refactored, to reduce the number of elif statements had. Refactoring allows the code to be cleaned up and become more organized.

Hacks . Add this Blog to you own Blogging site. In the Blog add notes and observations on each code cell. | In this implementation, do you see procedural abstraction? Yes, this implementation has a lot of procedural abstraction. There are functions created in order to be able to define what procedures we want to do in the code. For example, there are procedures defined for create, read, update, and delete. This allows us to have a broad function which can be used to add information to specific rows of the database. | . | In 2.4a or 2.4b lecture Do you see data abstraction? Complement this with Debugging example. There is data abstraction in this code. There are many things which are defined when creating a user, from their name to password to date of birth. These all need to be stored together, and using the code, we create a specific uid for the user which allows the rest of the data to be called from. The uid is essential in functions like update and delete, where data is removed or changed based on the user-specific uid. | . | Use Imperative or OOP style to Create a new Table or do something that applies to your CPT project.

            "content": "Debugging . Debugging is a very important step and it allows programmers to see a lot about their function and variables while debugging. I now understand why it is a valuable tool and why it is important to use while developing programs. In the image, we can see the debugging right as the app object will be created. We will be seeing the properties which can be defined within the app object.! We can see the User objects being created. The VSCode interface shows the variables for the class and how each user has their own specific values for the class blueprint. By stepping into the function, we can see what is going on during the creation of the user. We step into the function and see how the initialization of the user is done. This step is checked for the try portion and checks if the user is created. For this case, I had already created the users, so it would go into the except step. This screenshot shows the results of the schema being created. It uses the cursor object which has many function and special variables. This is the same for the connection objects. These objects are removed from the debugging interface after the code which closes them executes, showing that these objects close their connection after the code tells them to. This shows why the closing step is important, so it turns off the connection and reduces the resources needed. .",

For Question 1, answer A is incorrect because the ability to keep data secure is not a primary function of a compression algorithm. answer B is correct because lossless compression algorithms are guaranteed to be able to reconstruct the original data, while lossy compression algorithms are not. . Collegeboard Practice Problems for 2.3 . . Additional Practice Quizzes: . On the latter quiz for question 4, Answer D is correct because sorting by year will sort the spreadsheet on column C from least to greatest. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Since the order of the entries is not affected by the filters, the photograph with the lowest year value will be in the first row of the spreadsheet. Answer C is incorrect because this sequence of steps does not remove any entries with an unknown year, so the entry in the first row of the spreadsheet will have a year value of -1. .",

From Pandas Overview -- When working with tabular data, such as data stored in spreadsheets or databases, pandas is the right tool for you. pandas will help you to explore, clean, and process your data. In pandas, a data table is called a DataFrame. | . . &#39;&#39;&#39;Pandas is used to gather data sets through its DataFrames implementation&#39;&#39;&#39; import pandas as pd . Cleaning Data . When looking at a data set, check to see what data needs to be cleaned. Examples include: . Missing Data Points | Invalid Data | Inaccurate Data | . Run the following code to see what needs to be cleaned . df = pd.read_json(&#39;files/grade.json&#39;) print(df) # What part of the data set needs to be cleaned? # The columns student ID and year in school, the rows to be exact are row 8 and 4. GPA might also be need to be cleaned if the GPA here is unweighted # From PBL learning, what is a good time to clean data? Hint, remember Garbage in, Garbage out? # A good time to clean data is when the data is received. We should filter out garbage data as soon as it is entered. .

Machine Learning Visit Tutorials Point . Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

This is called &#39;Training&#39; or &#39;Cleaning&#39; data. . # Preprocess the data from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder td = titanic_data td.drop([&#39;alive&#39;, &#39;who&#39;, &#39;adult_male&#39;, &#39;class&#39;, &#39;embark_town&#39;, &#39;deck&#39;], axis=1, inplace=True) td.dropna(inplace=True) td[&#39;sex&#39;] = td[&#39;sex&#39;].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == &#39;male&#39; else 0) td[&#39;alone&#39;] = td[&#39;alone&#39;].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == True else 0) # Encode categorical variables enc = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown=&#39;ignore&#39;) enc.fit(td[[&#39;embarked&#39;]]) onehot = enc.transform(td[[&#39;embarked&#39;]]).toarray() cols = [&#39;embarked_&#39; + val for val in enc.categories_[0]] td[cols] = pd.DataFrame(onehot) td.drop([&#39;embarked&#39;], axis=1, inplace=True) td.dropna(inplace=True) print(td) . The result of &#39;Training&#39; data is making it easier to analyze or make conclusions. In looking at the Titanic, as you clean you would probably want to make assumptions on likely chance of survival. . This would involve analyzing various factors (such as age, gender, class, etc.) that may have affected a person&#39;s chances of survival, and using that information to make predictions about whether an individual would have survived or not. .

From Tutorials Point%20is,a%20consistence%20interface%20in%20Python). Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python.&gt; Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. Decision Trees, prediction by a piecewise constant approximation. - Logistic Regression, the probabilities describing the possible outcomes. | . | . from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score # Split arrays or matrices into random train and test subsets.

My Hacks . 2.3 Questions . A researcher is analyzing data about students in a school district to determine whether there is a relationship between grade point average and number of absences. The researcher plans on compiling data from several sources to create a record for each student. | The researcher has access to a database with the following information about each student. . Last name First name Grade level (9, 10, 11, or 12) Grade point average (on a 0.0 to 4.0 scale) The researcher also has access to another database with the following information about each student. . First name Last name Number of absences from school Number of late arrivals to school . Upon compiling the data, the researcher identifies a problem due to the fact that neither data source uses a unique ID number for each student. Which of the following best describes the problem caused by the lack of unique ID numbers? . Answer: There will be many students at the school that share the same first name. Without a unique student ID, students with the same name may get confused with eachother. So if one student&#39;s GPA may get confused with anothers, which would cause the researcher&#39;s data and analysis to be incorrect. . A team of researchers wants to create a program to analyze the amount of pollution reported in roughly 3,000 counties across the United States. The program is intended to combine county data sets and then process the data. Which of the following is most likely to be a challenge in creating the program? | Answer: Combining multiple data sets requires the involved data sets to have similar structures and calculations. One county may calculate pollution in different units (per sq acre vs per sq mile) than another county. County datasets may also differ in the frequency of data present. One county may have data on pollution for every year, but onther county may conduct that reaseach monthly. . A student is creating a Web site that is intended to display information about a city based on a city name that a user enters in a text field. Which of the following are likely to be challenges associated with processing city names that users might provide as input? | Answer: Anytime when user&#39;s are able to manually type into a field, there is always a chance the data collected from that field has &quot;garbage&quot; in it. Users may spell the city name wrong, use an abbreviation, or use a city nickname. A more user friendly program would plan for events like there by, for example, not only having city names in their data, but also city abbreviations. . A database of information about shows at a concert venue contains the following information. | Name of artist performing at the show Date of show Total dollar amount of all tickets sold Which of the following additional pieces of information would be most useful in determining the artist with the greatest attendance during a particular month? . Answer: The average proce of tickets would be the most helpful in determining the artist with the greatest attendence. The attendance for a specific show can be calculated by dividing the dollar amount of tickets sold by the average ticket price would give you how many people have bought tickets for that show. . A camera mounted on the dashboard of a car captures an image of the view from the driver’s seat every second. Each image is stored as data. Along with each image, the camera also captures and stores the car’s speed, the date and time, and the car’s GPS location as metadata. Which of the following can best be determined using only the data and none of the metadata? | Answer: Only a visual would show the number of bicycles the car passed. Neither the car’s speed, the date, time, or the car’s GPS location would be able to indicate the number of bicycles the care passed. . A teacher sends students an anonymous survey in order to learn more about the students’ work habits. The survey contains the following questions. | On average, how long does homework take you each night (in minutes) ? On average, how long do you study for each test (in minutes) ? Do you enjoy the subject material of this class (yes or no) ? Which of the following questions about the students who responded to the survey can the teacher answer by analyzing the survey results? . Do students who enjoy the subject material tend to spend more time on homework each night than the other students do? Do students who spend more time on homework each night tend to spend less time studying for tests than the other students do? Do students who spend more time studying for tests tend to earn higher grades in the class than the other students do? . Answer: Option 3 requires data outside of the survey, specifically the student&#39; grades. Both I and II only require data from within the survey. . 1990 vs. 2017 Carbon Emissions per Nation . Purpose: . The purpose of this dataset is to investigate the Carbon emissions for nations in 2017 vs in 1990. It allows people to see which nations increased in their emissions, which decreased, which nations are the greatest contibuters... I found a dataset on Kaggle, which had CO2 emissions for years 1990--&gt;2018. I created a json file, but only used the &quot;Country&quot; &quot;1990 Carbon Emissions&quot; and &quot;2017 Carbon Emissions.&quot; . import pandas as pd df = pd.read_json(&#39;files/co2em.json&#39;) print(df) #print raw .

My Answer: Neither grid I not grid II | Correct Answer: Grid I only | Explanation: In Grid I, the robot moves forward to the end of the bottom row, turns right twice, moves forward twice, turns right twice, moves forward until the end of the middle row, turns left twice, moves forward twice, turns left twice, and moves forward until Goal_Reached is true. | . Q29 . My Answer: true false true | Correct Answer: false false false | Explanation: This question was asking about a code segment and if the code segment displays a certain text. I did not understand this question very well. I put answer C which said true false true. I put this because the variables a, b, and c were defined as such. I did not understand what the code after that did so I thought it was meant just to throw me off. The correct answer is false, false, false. This is because the two code statments changed variables a and c. The a was changed to false because b was true thus not b is false. The statement then is false. The next one defines c as false because a is now defined as false making c false. If I got the correct answer on the fourth line of code I would have got it correct. | . Q31 . My Answer: Check if the time is outside business hours. If it is, check if the gate sensor is activated: If it is, check if the gate sensor is closed. If it is, turn on the motor. | Correct Answer: Check if the time is during business hours. If it is, check if the gate sensor is activated: If it is, check if the gate sensor is open. If it is, turn on the motor. | Explanation: I got this one wrong because I did not thoroughly read through the algorithm and the gate would open outside of business hours. Option D is correct because the gate would not open outside of business hours and the gate would open correctly. | . Q33 . My Answer: Repeat 3 Times | Correct Answer: Repeat 2 Times | Explanation: Here, I chose choice C when the correct answer was choice A. The code segment moves it right, forward, left, forward, and right. It does that 4 times. When I was going thru the steps in my head, it seemed correct that it would go thru 3 times. When I looked at it again just now, I saw that it would only need to repeat twice and repeating it 3 times would leave it three rows above its starting position and one row above the gray square. | . Q40 . My Answer: Interchange the rotate right and rotate left blocks | Correct Answer: No change is needed; the algorithm is correct as is | Explanation: I got this one wrong because interchanging the rotate_right and rotate_left blocks would push the robot off the grid. There would be no change needed in this algorithm. | . Q41 . My Answer: The genetic codes must be converted from binary to decimal numbers | Correct Answer: The list must be sorted based on the genetic code values | Explanation: I got this question wrong because the list has to be sorted in order of value in order to use a binary search algorithm. So, converting binary to decimal numbers is not necessary. | . Q49 . My Answer: The model used by the simulation software cannot be modified once the simulation has been used | Correct Answer: The model used by the simulation software often omits details so that it is easier to implement | Explanation: I honestly don’t know why I picked this answer. It makes no sense to be fair. A model can always be changed from a simulation stand point. Details will be omitted after the simulation is done. | . Q50 . My Answer: Algorithms A and B | Correct Answer: Algorithms A and D | Explanation: D: The number of steps for this algorithm is equal to the length of the list squared, as the number of steps is equal to n2 for a list of size n. This is an example of a polynomial efficiency and indicates that the algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time. | . B (incorrect): As the size of the list grows, the number of steps needed to sort the list grows at an exponential rate, as the number of steps is equal to 2n for a list of size n. This indicates that the algorithm does not run in a reasonable amount of time. . Final Thoughts and Blogging .

After googling “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”?”, we came to the conclusion that the average Facebook user is in the range of 25-34, and TikTok between ages 10-19. We are arguing that the differences between these average ages is simply due to a generation gap.

The reading discusses the topic of computer bias and its effects, specifically in the context of algorithms created by programmers. It raises questions about the possibility of intentional or purposeful bias in algorithms and technology, as well as the potential harm it can cause. The article looks at examples such as age group preferences for social media platforms, the use of female voices for virtual assistants, and an instance of a computer that was deemed “racist”.

            "content": "Big Idea 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects - Reflection . The Pros and Cons of Computer Science: . Increased Productivity and Efficiency: Computer Science has transformed our daily lives and work routines by providing more advanced tools for communication, data processing, and problem solving. However, it has also led to job automation and decreased employment opportunities. . Improved Education and Access to Information: With the advent of the internet and computer technology, people have greater access to educational resources and information. However, this has also contributed to the spread of false information and a decrease in focus and attention spans due to increased distractions. . Greater Connectivity and Globalization: Computer science has enabled people to connect and communicate globally, bridging geographical and cultural gaps. This has led to greater collaboration and understanding, but also to the spread of hate speech and cyber-bullying, and a decline in personal interactions. . Benefits of our Specific Project: . Allows users to better manage their business inventory and stock quantity | Good way for business to keep track of their inventory | People who use this application will see themselves more organized | . Potential Con: . May not be completely functional | . Dopamine and its Problems . With the advancement of technology, people, particularly teenagers, have become increasingly desensitized to dopamine, leading to the rise of dopamine detox lifestyles. Social media, in particular, provides users with a constant stream of dopamine through the simple act of scrolling through 15-second videos. This has contributed to the decline in attention span, with people now only having an attention span of less than 10 seconds. Content creators have adapted their products to cater to these short attention spans, resulting in a continuous boost of dopamine. However, this constant stimulation has caused a desensitization of dopamine among teens, leading to increased rates of depression and anxiety among Gen Z kids. The writer admits to spending an excessive amount of time on social media, despite not having a negative impact on their academics and social life. Despite this, they believe it is important to consider reducing their cell phone usage to avoid desensitization to dopamine. . 5.2 Reflection . The Steps to Digital Empowerment: . Improve digital literacy: Acquire the skills necessary to use technology effectively and safely, including knowledge of online privacy and security. Establish a strong online presence: Build a personal brand and create a professional profile on social media platforms. Secure personal information: Protect passwords, limit the information shared online, and stay alert for potential scams. Stay informed: Keep up with the latest technology trends and advancements to make informed decisions. Network and collaborate: Connect with like-minded individuals and build a professional network. Continuously learn and adapt: Stay curious and open to learning new skills and technologies to stay ahead in the ever-evolving digital world. The writer, who considers themselves digitally empowered, offers ways to help others who are not empowered, such as demonstrating how to do something, giving tips and tricks, and helping set up technology and tools. . Paper-based systems and bureaucratic processes can act as barriers to digital empowerment. By digitizing information and processes, organizations and governments can reduce the burden of paperwork, making it easier for individuals to access information and services, which can promote digital empowerment. However, in some cases, limitations such as restricted access to websites on school networks can hinder digital empowerment, as the writer has experienced while in school. Despite the need for security, restrictions on access to necessary resources can impede learning and growth. .",

SThe college board&#39;s grade and mine disagree in a few ways. I felt like mine was a little harder. whenever a description or code fragment is requested in an inquiry. I wouldn&#39;t notice anything when I looked at the question. The student may have clarified it elsewhere in their response, though. Additionally, I wasn&#39;t entirely sure where sequencing, selection, and iteration were located. I made an effort to find it, but I was forced to deduce it from the video. | My program will have to be quite intricate and capable of having a significant output input, function, and goal. It can&#39;t only be an information forum. It must have a function. | The original CPT failed to adequately describe the goal. It is crucial that on understanding the distinction between purpose and function. The objective of the program is purpose. Function is the means through which it is accomplished. A card game of some form could serve as the function and the purpose could be enjoyment. Additionally, this same project did a poor job of explaining things. | . I think my grade is on par with the marks the College Board gave the example projects. I am well aware of the requirements and what my project needs to succeed. My project must be complete, with a variety of features and abstraction, in order to satisfy all the requirements. I think I understtod most of the topics but some of the things I got confused on were related to the identification of lists and parameters. Sometimes it can be hard to distinguish between them but overall I feel that I learned a lot of new information. | .",

An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

Organization is also one thing I noticed may be important in the process of development. One of the most prominent reasons a submission may not have met the criteria in one area was a lack of detail in explaining how something works.

The written response describes the overall purpose clearly, describes the functionality of the program related to the video, and also describes the input and output in the video. | . Data Abstraction | 0 | 1 | The first segment of code does not show a list, it only shows a function. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The written response explains how the list manages complexity, and the code segment demonstrates it managing complexity. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The two code segments both show the procedure and it being called. The description of the procedure is also very detailed, and shows how it contributes to the overall functionality. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Sequencing, selection, and iteration are all in the program code segment. The steps on how the algorithm works is explained with great detail. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | Fully describes two calls to the procedure in 3c. the conditions and results of each call are clearly stated. | . Reflection: . For Submission 1, Collegeboard did not give the point for Program Pupose and Function because the purpose was not valid. However, I did award a point thinking that the purpose was good enough. This means that when I submit my project to Collegeboard, I should go deeper in the purpose and not just specify the overall function of the program(While also keeping it concise to about 1 sentence). For Submission 2, I did not give a point for Data Abstraction because I thought that you needed to take a screenshot of the variable of the list for the code segment. However, Collegeboard did give the point for Data Abstraction because the code segments did show the use of the lists. While the list wasn’t directly stated in the code segment, the code segment still shows the utilization of the lists which makes this category valid for a point. Also, the names of the lists were specified in 3.b.iii so the grader knows which variables are lists in the code. Therefore, a point for Data Abstraction was awarded. This tells to me that I should show the utilization of a list in the code segments rather than just showing the creation of the variable of the list. Overall, through grading these submissions, I realized that for much of 3a I do not have to write up a whole paragraph for each subsection. I am now aware that I should be more detailed in the code segments and on explaining the code when I will be making my project. .",

This lesson emphasized ways that which code can be efficiently and effectively written through use of libraries, documentation, and APIs. Libraries consist of pre-written code that can be utilizing in other programs. They help to simplify code by storing code segments and features in a separate place, this way, the code being run only has code that the user has written. A library’s documentation describes the different features of a library. Libraries are collections of code and scripts that can provide faster solvents to problems. . Problem 2: Multiple Choice . (1) What does the random(a,b) function generate? . A. A random integer from a to be exclusive | B. A random integer from a to b inclusive. | C. A random word from variable a to variable b exclusive. | D. A random word from variable a to variable b inclusive. | . (2) What is x, y, and z in random.randrange(x, y, z)? . A. x = start, y = stop, z = step | B. x = start, y = step, z = stop | C. x = stop, y = start, z = step | D. x = step, y = start, z = stop | . (3) Which of the following is NOT part of the random library? . A. random.item | B. random.random | C. random.shuffle | D. random.randint | . Problem 3: Short Answer Questions . (1) What is the advantage of using libraries? . Libraries have a distinct advantage of having pre-written code that can provide efficiency at a linear level. Libraries help to simplify complex programs by allowing the code to reference pre-written code. This reduces the workload for the user writing the code and improves reliability. This cuts out time that the user has to write repetitive code. The user can spend more time on the creative and work process then repetitive code writing. . (2) Write a thorough documentation of the following code. . import random # Saves user input in the in the comma seperated format names_string = input(&quot;Give me everybody&#39;s names, seperated by a comma.&quot;) # splits the stored user input by the character, comma, and stores each element in the list names names = names_string.split(&quot;,&quot;) # get the length of names num_items = len(names) # get random number within &lt; num_items random_choice = random.randint(0, num_items - 1) # figuring out randomly who to play person_who_will_pay = names[random_choice] # Prints the name random person name with message print(f&quot;{person_who_will_pay} is going to buy the meal today!&quot;) . Output . Brady is going to buy the meal today! . Problem 4: Coding Challenges! . (1) Create a program to pick five random names from a list of at least 15 names . import random # list of random names random_names = [&quot;Aaron Rodgers&quot;,&quot;Rob Gronkowski&quot;, &quot;Patrick Mahomes&quot;, &quot;Odell Beckham &quot;, &quot;Ben Roethlisberger&quot;, &quot;Russell Wilson&quot;, &quot;Cam Newton&quot;, &quot;Lamar Jackson&quot;, &quot;Antonio Brown&quot;, &quot;JJ Watt&quot;, &quot;Adrian Peterson&quot;, &quot;Keira&quot;, &quot;Deshaun Watson&quot;, &quot; Lionel Messi&quot;, &quot;Jerry Rice&quot;] i = 0 # printing 5 random names print(&quot;The five random names are:&quot;) while i &lt; 5: print(random.choice(random_names)) i += 1 . Output . Lamar Jackson Ben Roethlisberger Russell Wilson Adrian Peterson Deshaun Watson . (2) Create a program to simulate a dice game where each player rolls two fair dice (6 sides); the player with the greater sum wins . import random def playerA(): firstRoll = 0 firstRoll = random.randrange(1,6) secondRoll = 0 secondRoll = random.randrange(1,6) score = firstRoll + secondRoll return score def playerB(): firstRoll = 0 firstRoll = random.randrange(1,6) secondRoll = 0 secondRoll = random.randrange(1,6) score = firstRoll + secondRoll return score first = playerA() print(&quot;First Player rolled&quot;,first) second = playerB() print(&quot;Second Player rolled&quot;,second) if (first &gt; second): print(&quot;First Player won!&quot;) else: print(&quot;Second Player won!&quot;) . Output . First Player rolled 3 Second Player rolled 8 Second Player won! . EXTRA-CREDIT OPPORTUNITY: Create a program to randomly generate one of those 5x5 square CollegeBoard robot courses frequently seen in these lessons . EXTRA X 2: Put safeguards in your program to make sure the robot course is actually possible to complete. . import random # This &gt; is Start # This O is End # These # are obstacles print(&quot;Generating 3 randomized 5x5 squares:&quot;) count = 0 directions = [&quot;up&quot;, &quot;down&quot;, &quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;] while count &lt; 3: grid = [[&#39;_&#39; for _ in range(5)] for _ in range(5)] direction = random.choice(directions) obstacles = 12 for i in range(obstacles): row = random.randint(0, 4) col = random.randint(0, 4) grid[row][col] = &#39;#&#39; finish_row = random.randint(0, 4) finish_column = random.randint(0, 4) grid[finish_row][finish_column] = &#39;O&#39; start_row = random.randint(0, 4) start_column = random.randint(0, 4) grid[start_row][start_column] = &#39;&gt;&#39; print(&quot;Initial Direction: &quot; + direction) for row in grid: print(&#39; &#39;.join(row)) print(&quot;==========&quot;) count = count + 1 .

Make sure to provide at least one example of each. . &lt;font color=#FF0000&gt;Undecidable problems are problems that algorithms simply cannot solve. One of the first problems discovered is the halting problem. Most of these problems are paradoxical and theoretical situations where answers are most likely are subjective. However, some of these problems can have situations where some inputs have values. But not all values are going to have outputs.&lt;/p&gt; Decidable problems are problems that algorithms can return an output for all inputs.

This code would display . &quot;The minimum number is&quot; . This is because minimum is defined, but minimum is never displayed, and as a result the minimum number is not shown . Problem 2 . The correct choice would be PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (time/distance) }. As it matches the formula (total T/ total D). . Problem 3 . False. This would not print anything out, as it does not display anything in the body of the procedure, and when the function is called it does not display the return value. . Problem 4 . Answer 1. This is because we calculate the total footprint individually, per flight, then complete the total by adding the two. Also answer 3 as answer 3 first finds each individually, then adds the two up. . hacks section 12-13 . Problems 1/2/3 .

This will move the robot up, rotate it left. Then it moves up, rotates and moves right one extra, then the same, but to the left. Finally, it will move up one then move to the left one. Then it will move up 2 and move it right one. then it will go forwards, rotate right, then go forwards 2 through goForwardX . What is the correct name of the procedure? . A: PROCEDURE MYLIST. Technically, you can use the name MyList for a procedure, it is just that it still needs caps. using procedure in lowercase is not how collegeboard wants people to define procedures, and so PROCEDURE MYLIST (using full caps) is the best pick. . Second Robot Problem . PROCEDURE MoveForwardsUntil(direction, number){ while number != 0{ MOVE_FORWARD() if direction = right{ if not CAN_MOVE(right){ number -= 1 } } else if direction = left { if not CAN_MOVE(left){ number -= 1 } } } MOVE_FORWARD() } ROTATE_RIGHT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_LEFT() MoveForwardsUntil(right, 3) ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD . The procedure here decrements number by one every single time it passes a black block by checking whether it can move that way. That way, we can count to see how many black blocks we pass. Then the procedure makes the robot move one forward to ensure it is lined up. . New Robot Problem (I forgot to pull) &#128128; . PROCEDURE FinishCourse(){ while not Goal_Completed{ if not CAN_MOVE(forward){ if CAN_MOVE(left){ ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_RIGHT() } else if CAN_MOVE(right) { ROTATE_RIGHT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_LEFT() } else{ ROTATE_RIGHT() ROTATE_RIGHT() MOVE_FORWARD() } } MOVE_FORWARD() } } FinishCourse() . This procedure works because it just asks the robot to move forward until it reaches an obstacle. If it does, then it check first to turn left (because in this case it is more optimal), then to turn right, at which it turns, moves up one (to dodge the obstacle) and then turns back to realign itself. This repeats until it reaches the top, at which point it turns left infinitely until it reaches the goal. . Extra: Creating and finishing my own course . Code to Complete Course . PROCEDURE TurnXDeg(times_To_turn){ for i in range(times_To_turn){ ROTATE_RIGHT() } } PROCEDURE goForwardX(X){ for i in range x { MOVE_FORWARD()) } } TurnXDeg(2) goForwardX(2) TurnXDeg(1) goForwardX(4) TurnXDeg(1) goForwardX(3) TurnXDeg(1) goForwardX(2) TurnXDeg(3) MOVE_FORWARD() TurnXDeg(1) goForward(2) .

Binary search is more efficient than sequential search because sequential search goes one by one in the list comparing each value to the value you are looking for.

Task: Similar to insertion sort, this algorithm takes an unsorted array and returns a sorted array Unlike insertion sort where you iterate through the each element and move the smaller elements to the front, this algorithm starts at the beginning and swaps the position of every element in the array Expected Output The sorted array from 1-10 . list = [9, 8, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 1, 0] print(f&quot;array before sort {list}&quot;) def insertion_sort(list): for index in range(1,len(list)): # repeats through length of the array value = list[index] i = index - 1 while i &gt;= 0: if value &lt; list[i]: list[i+1] = list[i] # shift number in slot i to the right list[i] = value # shift value left into slot i i = i - 1 else: break IS = insertion_sort(list) print(f&quot;array after sort {list}&quot;) . array before sort [9, 8, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 1, 0] array after sort [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . MC Quiz . The only question I got wrong on the quiz is the 9th question, show below: . . The correct answer to this question is &quot;FOR loops&quot;. This is because a for loop keeps running for a set number of times, which would be the most appropriate in this situation when the user is iterating over a list UNTIL the user inputs ‘quit’. I said that it would be a while loop, since I thought that it was a conditional statement if the user was inputting ‘quit’. . Reflection . Throughout these sections, I gained a better understanding of many different concepts. I learned more in depth about the main types of loops (for, while, recursive), and I was also able to learn more about the importance of iterations and lists. Learning more about certain features of lists such as the append and pop option allows me to automate certain code snippets in a more efficient manner, rather than nesting identical code to complete the same task, but in a more tedious manner. .",

Show two examples and label which one is sequence, selection, iteration . numbers = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] evens = [] odds = [] for i in numbers: if (numbers[i] % 2 == 0): evens.append(numbers[i]) for i in numbers: if (numbers[i] % 2 == 1): odds.append(numbers[i]) print(numbers[2]) print(evens) print(odds) . 2 [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10] [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] . Explanation . What is happening in this code is that print(numbers[2]) is printing the numbers list but only the item with the value of 2, so it will output 2. Printing evens is making a math function and then if the remainder is 0 it will make a new list. Printing odds is making a math function and them if the remainder of that when divided by 2 is 1, then it makes a new list with odd numbers from the original list . Answers 1 . All the steps combined are sequencing . The step &quot;for i in numbers:&quot; is iteration because they go through all the numbers. . &quot;if (numbers[i] % 2 == 0)&quot; is selection because they sort each number to find the even ones. . i = 1 starString = &quot;*&quot; while i &lt;= 5: j = 1 while j &lt;= i: print (&quot;*&quot;, end= &quot;&quot;) j += 1 print () i += 1 . * ** *** **** ***** . Explanation . i is set to 1 and then another variable is set to a star. Then another variable is j which is also set to 1. The function keeps repeating itself over and over until i is not equal to or less than 5. . Answers 2 . All the steps are a sequence . &quot;While i &lt;= 5:&quot; is iteration because they repeat until i reaches 5 . &quot;While j &lt;= i:&quot; is selection because this is where they decide what j is . 3.3 Video 2 Hacks . Practice Problems . given the following code segment below: | a ⟵ 7 . b ⟵ 1 . c ⟵ 3 . d ⟵ 4 . a ⟵ b . b ⟵ c + d . d ⟵ b . find the value for a, b, c, d: 7 . My Answer: a: 1 b: 7 c: 3 d: 7 . Explanation . First a is set equal to b so a is 1. then b becomes the sum of c and d so b becomes 7. Then d is set equal to b so then d becomes 7 since b was redefined in the last line of code. c is never redefined so it stays the same. . Click for the answer! a = 1, b = 7, c = 3, d = 7 consider the following code segment: | hot ⟵ true . cold ⟵ false . cold ⟵ hot . hot ⟵ cold . what are the values of hot and cold after executing the code segment? . the value of hot is true, the value of cold is true | the value of hot is false, the value of cold is true | the value of hot is true, the value of cold is false | the value of hot is false, the value of cold is false | My Answer: 1 . Explanation . This is because cold becomes set equal to hot, so we know both variables are equal to true. Since the variable cold has been redefined, when hot is set equal to cold, so both variables are equal to hot, so it is option 1. . Click for the answer! 1. the value of hot is true, the value of cold is true Make TWO of your own code segments that contain at least 5 defined variables, then provide the answer and EXPLAIN why your answer is correct. | Given the following code segment below: . w ⟵ boat . a ⟵ walk . t ⟵ sea . e ⟵ separate . r ⟵ cane . w ⟵ t r ⟵ e t ⟵ r . What is the value of w? . Click for the answer! sea This is the answer because the value of w is only changing once, and that it is becoming equal to the value of t, which is sea. a = &quot;apple&quot; b = &quot;ball&quot; c = &quot;cake&quot; d = &quot;dessert&quot; e = &quot;elephant&quot; a=c c=a b=d d=a e=b print(a) . cake . Click for the answer! cake because a is only being changed once and it is being set to c which is cake. The output would be cake because a is only redefined once when it is set equal to c. That means that a is set to cake and when a is printed it will output cake. Sequencing | num1 = 3 num2 = 1 num3 = 5 num1 = num2 + num3 num2 = num1 + num3 # num2 is now the new num1 + num3 . What is the value of num1 and num2? . My Answers: num1 = 6 num2 = 11 . Click for the answer! num1 = 6, num2 = 11. This is because num1 is redefined as the sum of num2 and num3, so then it becomes 5+1 so num1 is equal to 6. num2 is defined as the sum of num1 and num3, but since num1 was redefined we have to use the new value. Then it will be 6+5, which is 11. Score: 1/1 . 3.4 Video 1 Hacks . String Homework .

Explanation . You can see the output of each one after the line of code. When var is assigned the output will be just B because it is taking the substring of &quot;Bob&quot;. name is assigned lastName and var so it is combining them to make SmithB. Then email is combining name and @gmail.com so the final output SmithB@gmail.com . My Answer: SmithB@gmail.com . Hint: var = &quot;B&quot; name = &quot;SmithB&quot; . .

My Answer: ompuook . Explanation . You can see the outputs after each line of code. Length 1 is taking the length of word 1 which is 8 and dividing it by 2 to get 4. Length 2 is taking the length of word 2 and dividing it by 3 to get 3. The variable first is taking the 2nd letter to the 4th letter of word1 so the output will be ompu. The variable second substring too word2 and then found the length and added 3 to it to get 6 and get the other character of 3. We have to reverse it to get [3,6] so the output will be ook. All this is assigned to another variable called newWord and then printed to get ompuook. . Answers . Test 1 . Result: &quot;SmithB@gmail.com&quot; . Test 2 . | Result: &quot;ompuook&quot; | .",

Algorithms can be expressed in a variety of ways and can be executed by programs which are implemented using programming languages. | An algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task, us as humans, do algorithms on a daily basis. | . 3 Steps of Algorithms . 1. Sequencing . Sequencing is doing steps in order. | . 3. Selection . Selection is when the programmer decides between two different outcomes. | . 3. Iteration . Iteration is when you have to repeat a step until that condition is fulfilled. | . Video 2 . Vocabulary . algorithm- finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task, composed of sequencing, selection, and iteration. | selection- a section of code is run only if a condition is met. | iteration- repeating steps or instructions over and over again | sequencing- outline or set of steps that we do and follow in order that they are given | variable- you can store an actual value, the value of a variable in another variable, the result of an operation, or result of a procedural call | . Video 3 . Arithmetic Operators . plus signs are addition | subraction signs are subtraction | asterisk/star is multiplication | slash indicates division | . Unit 3.4 . Video 1 . Vocabulary . String: a sequence of characters | Len: finds the number of characters in a string (length) | String concatenation: combines two or more strings into one (combines words/letters) | Substring: a part of a existing string | . Hacks . 3.3 Video 1 Hacks . numbers = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] evens = [] for i in numbers: if (numbers[i] % 2 == 0): evens.append(numbers[i]) print(evens) . [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10] . Sequencing: when the code runs through the all steps. | Iteration: when the code goes through the numbers &quot;for i in numbers&quot; | Selection: when the code picks even numbers by using the code &quot;if (numbers[i] % 2 == 0);&quot; | . i = 1 starString = &quot;*&quot; while i &lt;= 5: j = 1 while j &lt;= i: print (&quot;*&quot;, end= &quot;&quot;) j += 1 print () i += 1 . * ** *** **** ***** . Sequencing: when the code runs through the all steps. | Iteration: when the code line &quot;while i &lt;= 5&quot; runs because it repeats until the asteriks reach 5. | Selection: when the code line &quot;while j &lt;= i&quot; runs because it chosses j. | . 3.3 Video 2 Hacks . Code segment . a ⟵ 7 . b ⟵ 1 . c ⟵ 3 . d ⟵ 4 . a ⟵ b . b ⟵ c + d . d ⟵ b . find the value for a, b, c, d . My answer: . a = 1 | b = 7 | c = 3 | d = | . . Code Segment . hot ⟵ true . cold ⟵ false . cold ⟵ hot . hot ⟵ cold . What are the values of hot and cold after executing the code segment? . the value of hot is true, the value of cold is true | the value of hot is false, the value of cold is true | the value of hot is true, the value of cold is false | the value of hot is false, the value of cold is false | My Answer: . | . Creating my own two code segments . Consider the following code segment: . num1 ⟵ 25 | num2 ⟵ 15 | num3 ⟵ 30 | num2 ⟵ num3 | num3 ⟵ num1 | num1 ⟵ num2 | . DISPLAY(num1) . DISPLAY(num2) . DISPLAY(num3) . What is displayed after running this code segment? . 25 15 30 | 30 30 25 | 30 15 30 | 15 30 25 | Click for the answer! 2. because for num 1 the value is replaced by num 3&#39;s value which is 30. For num 2 the value is 30 because its replaced by num 1&#39;s value which was originally 25 but then was replaced by num 3&#39;s value 30. For num 3, the value is 25 because it&#39;s value is replaced by num 2 which num 2&#39;s value was replaced by num 1&#39;s. . Consider the following code segment: . p ⟵ 10 | q ⟵ 20 | r ⟵ 30 | s ⟵ 40 | p ⟵ q | q ⟵ r | s ⟵ q | r ⟵ p | . What is the value of r as a result of running this code segment . 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | Click for the answer! 2. because q is the variable assigned to p and q&#39;s value is 20. . Sequencing .

Caesar ciphers use a substitution method where letters in the alphabet are shifted by some fixed number of spaces to yield an encoding alphabet. A Caesar cipher with a shift of 1 would encode an A as a B, an M as an N, and a Z as an A, and so on. The method is named after Roman leader Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence! . alphabet = [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;f&#39;, &#39;g&#39;,&#39;h&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;j&#39;, &#39;k&#39;, &#39;l&#39;, &#39;m&#39;, &#39;n&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;p&#39;, &#39;q&#39;, &#39;r&#39;, &#39;s&#39;, &#39;t&#39;, &#39;u&#39;, &#39;v&#39;, &#39;w&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;y&#39;, &#39;z&#39;] text = input(&quot;Type your message: n&quot;).lower() #asks for user&#39;s message print(&quot;Your message is: &quot; + text) shift = int(input(&quot;Type the shift number: n&quot;)) #asks for shift number print(f&quot;Your shift number is: {shift}&quot;) def encrypt(text, shift): #define function cipher_text = &quot;&quot; #set cipher_text to empty for letter in text: #looping through each letter in the user&#39;s message position = alphabet.index(letter) #set letter&#39;s alphabet index to variable position new_position = position + shift #set the letter&#39;s new position with shift number new_letter = alphabet[new_position] #new letter with new position cipher_text += new_letter #add letters one by one to empty cipher_text print(f&quot;Your encoded text is: {cipher_text}&quot;) #print the encoded text encrypt(text, shift) .

Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary.

List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many Dictionary is used to define data patterns. Iteration is often used to process through lists. To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration we will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list In the example below, the expression appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure.

Formatted output of Dictionary Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet or preparing it to be stored into a database. Also, it is a great way to exchange data inside of our own programs. . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. . InfoDb = [] def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Gender:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Gender&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Email:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Email&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Phone Number:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;PhoneNumber&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Age:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Age&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Hobbies: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Hobbies&quot;])) print() # for loop iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;Formatted for loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() . Formatted for loop output . While loop In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . While loop output . Recursion (calling a loop repeatedly) This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Recursive loop output .

            "content": "Final Test Review . I completed the Final Test for AP Computer Science Principles at Friday night from 10:30 to 11:30 right before I slept. My performance was definitely skewed by the conditions of my test, as I got a 48/50 and incorrectly answered easier questions related to actions that DevOps (a role that I had) would have experience in. This is my entire performance summary as provided by AP Classroom: As shown above, the only questions I missed was #16 and #17. This is the overview of my performance for each question: For question 16, I chose A because I read the the first 6 words (“The message is broken into packets”) and chose that answer. However, I didn’t realize that there was another answer that also had those first 6 words but had a different second part. I understand why that answer would make sense because if computers had to receive messages as shown in choice A, they would become way more inefficient and the development of large-scale social media networks (such as Discord). For question 17, I chose A because I used the literal definition of a protocol to select my answer. However, I didn’t realize that open protocols also involved the first part of word (“open”) and would provide a way to standardize data transmission between different devices. In addition, protocols are agreed-upon sets of rules that specify the behavior of a system. Protocols used on the Internet enable devices from different manufacturers to communicate in a standard way. . Summary of the Event (Presenting Our Project) . Night at the Museum (N@TM) was on November 3, 2022. There were four time slots for the different classes, and we (period 5 Yeung) had to be at the event to present our work from 7:00pm-7:30pm. Me and another teammate decided to bring our laptops to the event so that we could show curious people and the teacher our final project. Mr. Mortensen said that we needed to bring someone with us to the event, so I decided to bring my older brother with me so that he too could see our work. All of us had the opportunity to present to guests who attended the event, and the room was very crowded with teams from both classes having their laptops out. After the teacher saw our project functioning the way it was supposed to and showing our work to everybody, we all left the room to go and look at work from other electives. . Projects from Other Classes . After our time to present ended, we all went around to other electives to check out their work, such as 3D Animation, Ceramics, AP Studio Art, and many more. I was fascinated by what I was seeing and was amazed at how talented students around my age can be with their art work. I could very much see a lot of effort and dedication was put into the pieces that I saw, and it overall made me feel inspired to start approaching any art-related activites with a positive mindset. . Here are pictures of some of the artwork that I took at N@TM! I hope you like them as much as I did! :) . .",

When it comes to engineering, there is an extensive use of science, math, logic, and algorithms to solve problems | Engineering can change the world (and has a good salary!), which inspired Suma to pursue a career in that field (specifically electronics and communication) | There are a variety of streams you can take with engineering, such as biomedical, aerospace, software, electronics and communication, and many more | Suma’s very first job made her nervous at first, but over time, it became easier to mingle with the other students and share exepriences with one another | Qualcomm is a corporation that creates services related to networking and wireless technology Designs wireless telecommunications products | Integrated GPUs | Artifical intelligence products | Inventors of CDM technology | Wants to bring benefits of mobiles to other domains of engineering | It is more than just sitting in front of a laptop! | Volunteering + fun team activities | . | Nisha - director of engineering at Qualcomm | As a kid, Nisha was fascinated by how engineers made useful, innovative products | Fell in love with computer-related engineering because of how well she was doing in math in high school | Initially did not know what she was doing going into engineering | Excited to move to San Diego because that was a city where Qualcomm existed and where the headquarters of her team company were | . Questions . How do you know what side of engineering you want to pursue (software, hardware, etc.) . Keep a growth mindest! | It is important to know what you love | It can be hard to know what your interests are, so it is a good idea to do some research and see what fields resonate the most with you | More exposure may allow you to narrow down some of the things that you like the most | . What is the difference between software and hardware engineering? . Hardware - designs the electronics, develop chips using languages | Software - write the software for the electronics | . What universities specialize in software engineering? . Most universities with engineering will have a software engineering field (i.e. cpmputer science) | In Calfiornia, we have many universities with great university programs | . What are majors that would help me learn the necessary skills and concepts to get a software developer job in tech app companies? . Any tech company (Google, Amazon, Apple, etc.) looks for software engineers | . What should I do in high school to increase my chances to get admitted into these universities? . Challenge yourself when you are in school | Go above and beyond, take honors classes | Take some community college classes in your junior and senior years of high school | Colleges look very closely at acadmeic rigor | . What is one thing you wish you had done earlier that would have greatly helped you with engineering? . Take advantage of any programs that your school may have | This way, you will be better prepared for engineering | . What were some of your biggest challenges and how did you handle them? . When Suma gave birth to her first kid, she had to focus on her kid | Difficult for her to balance between motherhood and work, but with time, she got better at it | Back then, one could not Google resources to help them with engineering | . What are some competitions that I can participate in where I can apply what I have learned? . See if you can join the first Robotics program | Try to find a team in the community that you live in | Gaming companies in San Diego (i.e. Rocket League) | . Personal Takeaways from the Event . After attending the event, I was really fascinated to listen to each of the engineers’ stories, as hearing them made me realize that the journey to become an engineer is a lot of work. I also liked hearing the speakers talk about Qualcomm, as personally, my dad has worked there as a software engineer for many years. Overall, this event has inspired me to possibly pursue a career in some type of engineering, as I know that there are many of opportunities for aspiring engineers like me. .",

Personal Takeways . Watching these videos definitely opened my mind to how crucial collaboration is, especially in a field like computer science. I hope that from now on, my team and I will be able to communicate with each other and help each other no matter the circumstances. . 1.2: Daily Video 1 . Computing Innovations . Innovations can include, but are not limited to: . Applications Games | Social Media | Business | Productivity | . | Physical Devices Computers | Smart Phones/tablets | Smart “Things” | Wearables | . | Systems E-commerce | Cloud services | E-mail | . | . Innovations Created for a Purpose . Guiding Questions: . Why does the computing innovation exist? | What problem(s) does the computing innovation solve? | What does the computing innovation allow us to do that we could not do before? | Examples of Computing Innovations . Social Media Applications Allows users to connect from a distance and archive their activites | . | E-commerce Allows users to save time and money by being able to shop from home | . | Digital Assistant Device Allows users to control their devices hands-free making them safer while driving or more convenient when trying to multitask | . | . Daily Video 1: Takeaways . The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interest through creative expression | An understanding of the purpose of a computing innovations provides developers with an improved ability to develop that computing innovation | . 1.2: Daily Video 2 . Identifying Inputs to Programs . Computer Programs accept input in a variety of different forms: . tactile (touch) | audio | visual | text (including numerical values) | . Examples: . Smart phone/tablet (texting, entering password, etc.) | Laptop computer (keyboard, mouse, etc.) | Gaming console (send input through buttons) | . How do programs receive input? . Most programs are written in an event driven environment. . “Events” are triggered by some action, which usually sends input to the program | . Types of events a user can trigger: . mouse clicks | screen taps/swipes (force touch) | . What does input accomplish in a program? . Input usually affects the output. Outputs produced by a device can include: . visual | audio | tactile (touch/feel) | text | . Example of output that devices supply: . Smart phone/tablet (things that appear on screen based on what you have pressed/swiped) | Laptop computer (displays texts after using keyboard) | Gaming console (remote vibrations) | . How does a program know what to do upon an event? . An action triggers an event: . Action may be activated by the user or another program/device | . The program “jumps” to the code segment according to the event: . The code segment is ran | Output is triggered by the code segment/additional events that are triggered | . The program does not necessarily execute “in order”: . Code segments are executed as they are called, according to the events triggered | . Daily Video 2: Takeaways . Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text | An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program | Events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution | Inputs USUALLY affect the output produced by a program | Program output is usually based on a program’s input or prior state | . 1.2: Daily Video 3 . What is a program? . A program is a collection of statements: . A statement is a single command | A group of statements is called a code segment | A program is often referred to as “software” | Code segments are executed by rules of the coding language | . What does the program shown in the video do? - written to find the minimum value in a list . The code segment should work for a variety of different lists, such as numbers that are out of order, negative numbers, large numbers, and decimals | . Description . Simply state what the segment does this way, someone else can use the segment in a larger program | . | Include how it does what it does this way, someone could expand upon the code segment | . | . Daily Video 3: Takeaways . A program is a collection of program statements that performs a task when run by a computer | A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program | A program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations | . Personal Takeways . After watching all three videos, I feel that I truly understand why knowing the purpose and function of a program is essential. Knowing exactly what your program is intended to do could allow someone who is reading it to use it in a larger program or even expand upon it. Overall, having knowledge about this big idea will definitely be helpful and I will apply this idea to anything that I do in this class. . 1.3: Daily Video 1 . How is a program developed? . It all starts with an idea. . Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind | Developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan | At times, the development is more exploratory than anything, and the steps are dictated by what happens (both good and bad) | . Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect . Investigation is an important step in the process | Developers must: determine the requirements of the program | understand the constraints | understand the user concerns and interests | . | How do developers investigate? surveys | user testing | interviews | direct observations | . | . After initial investigation and reflection… . Developers design the program by brainstorming (draw on investigation) | storyboarding the program | planning user experience | laying out the user interface | organizing into modules | develop a testing strategy | . | Developers decide on the program requirements that… describe how a program should behave | include a list of user interactions | . | The program specifications outline all of the requirements | Developers create a prototype of the program (or components): a gradual process is frequently used so that developers can refine small parts (modules) of the program | . | . Testing, testing, and more testing! . Developers test the program every step of the way | Testing occurs at the micro level | macro level | . | Developers refine and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection | . Daily Video 1 Personal Takeaways . After watching the first daily video of 1.3, I now realize that if I want to have my idea for the final project behave like it is supposed to that numerous trials of the program will have to be run. This way, we can all see what parts of the program should be kept as is and which parts need to be modified to ensure optimal user experience. . 1.3: Daily Video 2 . How is a program developed? . Program development is seldom a solo endeavor . Typically, programs are developed by teams of people | Individuals/teams work on different functional components | Each member of the project deserves to receive credit for their work | Their names must be written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions to the project | . While documentation is an important place to give credit… . Many projects use comments within the programming language to give credit | This is an important part of the development of the program | When developers find a bug/error in a program, they need to be able to determine who can/should fix the problem | This may be most useful after a program is completed, and users find additional bugs | . Many times developers use code segments, procedures, algorithms, and more that are written by others. . These other individuals are not necessarily a part of the project, but they still deserve to be credited | Similar to quoting someone in a research paper or article | Any code segments, procedures, or algorithms are considered intellectual property of the author | The program documentation should include the author’s name and the source of any code segments being used | This portion of the documentation may resemble a bibliography or a works cited pages in a research paper | . Daily Video 2 Personal Takeways . I now know that any time I use code segments or algorithms, whether they are from my teammates or outside sources, I should always in some way give credit to the original author of that part of the program. This is because any code segments, procedures, or algorithms are considered intellectual property of the author. . 1.3: Daily Video 3 . How is a program developed? . Programmers create something called program documentation in order to… . describe the overall program | list program specifications | describe… functions/procedures/methods within the code | specific code segments | list of events and corresponding outputs | the development of the program | how other programs may interact with the program | . | list of contributors/authors of the program | . When does documentation happen? . Documentation happens throughout the development of the program: . At the beginning: list specifications | During: to keep track of proceess | After: to explain the overall process Documentation throughout can improve: | efficiency of overall programming process | programmers’ ability to test and refine the program | programmers’ response to bugs | . How do programmers document while programming? . Most programming languages offer a commenting feature, although some do not. . Commenting allows programmers to write text within the prgoram | This text does not affect the program | Comments are for programmers to read | This is a form of documentation and can be very usefil when programmers collaborate or work individually | . Examples of comments . Text Languages: . Python Uses the “#” symbol followed by the comment | . | Java Uses the “//” symbol” | /* */ used for multiple line comments | /** */ used for multiple line documentation comments | . | Javascript, C/C++, or Swift similar to Java | XML/HTML ”&lt;&gt;” used for single or multi line comments | . | Applescript/Pascal ”(Comments)” used for single or multi line | . | . Daily Video 3 Personal Takeways . After watching this video, I now understand why it is important to include comments in code, as it allows one to understand what something does and how it was developed. . Proof of Completion of Questions . Program Function and Purpose Quiz (MCQs): . . Program Design and Development Quiz: . . Collaboration Quiz: . . Questions: . How is the pseudocode in the AP Computer Science Principles exam implemented in these multiple-choice questions? | Can collaboration include sharing ideas while working on different parts of a project independently? | How can our team incorporate the concept of collaboration into our project? | .",

Even though students at Yale are very privileged to be at a place like Yale, they are so stressed and filled with anxiety because they are overwhelmed and incredibly busy all the time. | Here are some ways that Yale students are negatively by stress: Students are so stressed that they can’t make use of all the good opportunities presented to them. | Students are too stressed to enjoy the small pleasures and do things that students love(ex: reading a book). | . | . College Student Mental Health Statistics (2009 Study) . 40% of college students report more than the average level of stress | About 1/3 of students report being so depressed that it’s difficult to function | Over 40% often feel hopeless | A little under 50% say they experience overwhelming anxiety | Over 50% report often feeling very lonely | Over 80% say they fell overwhelmed by the amount of work they have to do every day | . Psychology and the Good Life Class . Laurie Santos created this course to help students understand and deal with stress and anxiety in college | There were two parts to the Psychology and the Good Life Course: Understanding positive psychology and how to make the positive changes in your life | Actually practicing the good habits (this is important because it’s one thing to understand what you should be doing to improve your mental health, but it’s another to actually implement the key ideas into your own life) | . | This course performed so well that it became the most popular course at Yale. The reason why this course performed so well was because many students were having trouble dealing with their stress and anxiety | . | Important insights that students can take away from the course: Your level of well being can be improved through the correct practices and measures taken to improve it. | We think that our life circumstances (such as occupation and salary) matter a lot, but they don’t matter nearly as much as we think | Sleep is very important for brain development and well being (and high school and college students aren’t getting enough) | It’s important to be aware of the present moment because it enables you to notice and enjoy the good things in your life. This can be practiced with practices like meditation. | It’s important to prioritize time over money | . | .",

            "title": "App Lab Quiz Notes",
            "content": "Link . Here’s the link to our AppLab project: https://studio.code.org/… . Initial Thinking . Harsha and I want to build a quiz application that is user-friendly and easy to code. We want to avoid repetitive code so that we can have the most efficient programming experience. Our plan is to create an app that can support the selection of different quizzes given a dropdown selection. We want it to have 4 choices on each answer screen with only one correct answer. We also want to have a final screen which displays the score out of 3 as well as a percentage. There should be a way to go back to the main screen to retake a quiz or take the other quiz. Finally, there should be a “How to Play” screen for anyone confused about where to start. . Design Work . Harsha and I met up outside of school and did some sketches for the app on an iPad. We decided that we wanted to have a front screen with 3 images and a dropdown to select the quiz. On each question, we wanted to have a text box for the current quiz question and a 2x2 grid to display the answer choices with images and labels. We also planned out a score page that showed how many questions they got right out of 3 and percent accuracy with which they completed the quiz. The how to play screen was something Harsha designed on the fly by himself since we didn’t originally plan it but we wanted to add more features. . Creation . . Harsha and I used the JavaScript editor for quite a bit of our code. We used it to define the calculus quizzes in JavaScript objects. We used block coding to define onEvent listeners and setProperty calls because it has useful autocompletion features for the IDs of elements and their respective properties/emitters. . We designed the quiz in such a way that all the questions would live on one screen. When the user clicks the “next” or “submit” button, the following function runs” . var score = 0; var a=0; var c=0; var e=0; onEvent(&quot;hpButtonStart&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { setScreen(&quot;q1Screen&quot;); }); // q1 onEvent(&quot;q1ButtonNext&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { setScreen(&quot;q2Screen&quot;); a=getTime(); }); onEvent(&quot;q1ButtonB&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { var b=getTime(); score+=10-((b-a)/1000000000000); setText(&quot;q1Text&quot;,&quot;Your score is: &quot;+score); }); // q2 onEvent(&quot;q2ButtonNext&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { setScreen(&quot;q3Screen&quot;); c=getTime(); }); onEvent(&quot;q2ButtonC&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { var d=getTime(); score+=10-((d-c)/1000000000000); setText(&quot;q2Text&quot;,&quot;Your score is: &quot;+score); }); . This function will set the label text, image sources, and question text to the next question without having to switch screens, avoiding repeated element creation and centralizing all the quiz logic in a single function. Additionally, it reduces the amount of event listeners being created (1 for each of the total 4 images). . Program Purpose &amp; Function . A quiz to assess the user’s knowledge of calculus | Should display the user’s score at the end to show their understanding | . Data Abstraction . Definition of the a=getTime() and score variables containing objects representing the quizzes for each sport | Separated from functions that are actually using the data | . Managing Complexity . Use of a single screen to display all quiz questions using “containers” for images, the question, and the answer labels Setting certain properties on these based on the current question to show the correct information | Creation of functions to abstract away logic for changing each of these individual parts of the quiz screen | . | . Procedural Abstraction . Use of functions to update images, questions, and choices | Use of function to abstract away quiz logic and execute the correct quiz based on user | Use of function to set the current selected answer choice Changes previously selected answer label’s color, sets newly selected answer label’s color, and sets the current selected answer choice in a global variable | . | . Algorithm Implementation . Creation of a nextQuestion algorithm that procedurally fills in the correct question, labels, and answer choices for each quiz question Handles answer choice colors, text value of the “next” button (changes to “submit” for the last question) | Handles quiz ending scenario | . | . Testing . Use of console.log to debug unwanted behavior | Use of console.log to test the scoring feature Logged each correct answer, incorrect answer, and overall score) | . | .",

            "content": "College Board Create Performance Task . Plan and Ideas . A program that creates a hangman game for the user. . Row 1: Program Purpose and Function . Assesses students’ ability to explain how a code segment or program functions. Know the difference between program purpose and function The purpose and function is what the program was meant to do Examples: The purpose of the Quiz program: To assess knowledge on a topic. The purpose of InfoDb: To store and access user information. . The purpose of this game is to create a word guessing game, where the user guesses certain letters, and the program will automatically fill in any letters present in the target word that the user inputs. After a given amount of tries, if the user hasn’t guessed the word, the game will fail itself. . Row 2: Data Abstraction . Assesses students’ ability to use abstraction to manage complexity in a program. The Abstraction and storage of data in a generalized container, e.g. variables, lists, dictionaries . The hangman game will predominantly use lists and variables to store the necessary data for the game. The variables could hold the different “stages” of the hangman ascii-art. On the otherhand, lists could be used to keep track of the already used letters, the target word, and the letters that were found in the target word. DOing so would allow for easy manipulation of the data stored and processed by the user. . Row 3: Managing Complexity . Assesses students’ ability to explain how abstraction manages complexity. The print_data function in the InfoDb project helps to reduce the amount of code that has to be written, as the code under print_data was abstracted from the function that was pre-defined. . Helps to reduce complexity in the code as everything is compartmentalized. . Individual functions and classes could be created to compartmentalize certain processes to reduce the clutter and repitition in the code. One function could be used to verify the prescence of a letter in a word, another function could be used to check if the game has been won, and a final main function could be made with a loop that runs the overall game. . Row 4: Prodecural Abstraction . Assesses students’ ability to use abstraction to manage complexity in a program. The print_data function used in the InfoDb project was abstracted into the various for loops that the program used. . The many functions and classes used in the hangman game could be abstracted in the program to manage the overall complexity of the game. . Row 5: Algorithm Implementation . Assesses students’ ability to implement and apply an algorithm. An algorithm is a methodology or a logical path that a computer follows to properly, . Ex: The percentage of the score in the quiz was an example of an algorithm Some algorithms that could be implemented in this project could be a way of keeping track of total number of attempts taken or checking if a game has been won, (e.g. all of the spaces have been filled out with letters) . Row 6: Testing . Assesses students’ ability to investigate the situation, context, or task. Testing is running over all the processes in a program and ensuring that everything works. The ability to find, detect, and fix any bugs apparent in the program. . Some testing that could be done on the project could be testing for accepting inputs from the user (subsituting a letter in when it’s found to be correct), or testing the proper game end and game start events. . How to Get a Five . Review Past Notes From Class . Be sure to be clear on the vocab and content taught in the class. Be parepared to be able to properly define each vocabulary and provide examples to each vocab. Any questions that cannot be answered with my notes, ask the teammates first and then consult the internet. If the problems still remains unsolved, consult the teacher about it. . Look At Previous Collegeboard Submissions &amp; Assignments . Learn from the past submissions of other people, plan ahead of time what to consider and what to add to my project. .",

Caesar ciphers use a substitution method where letters in the alphabet are shifted by some fixed number of spaces to yield an encoding alphabet. A Caesar cipher with a shift of 1 would encode an A as a B, an M as an N, and a Z as an A, and so on. The method is named after Roman leader Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence! . alphabet = [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;f&#39;, &#39;g&#39;,&#39;h&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;j&#39;, &#39;k&#39;, &#39;l&#39;, &#39;m&#39;, &#39;n&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;p&#39;, &#39;q&#39;, &#39;r&#39;, &#39;s&#39;, &#39;t&#39;, &#39;u&#39;, &#39;v&#39;, &#39;w&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;y&#39;, &#39;z&#39;] text = input(&quot;Type your message: n&quot;).lower() #asks for user&#39;s message print(&quot;Your message is: &quot; + text) shift = int(input(&quot;Type the shift number: n&quot;)) #asks for shift number print(f&quot;Your shift number is: {shift}&quot;) def encrypt(text, shift): #define function cipher_text = &quot;&quot; #set cipher_text to empty for letter in text: #looping through each letter in the user&#39;s message position = alphabet.index(letter) #set letter&#39;s alphabet index to variable position new_position = position + shift #set the letter&#39;s new position with shift number new_letter = alphabet[new_position] #new letter with new position cipher_text += new_letter #add letters one by one to empty cipher_text print(f&quot;Your encoded text is: {cipher_text}&quot;) #print the encoded text encrypt(text, shift) .

List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many Dictionary is used to define data patterns. Iteration is often used to process through lists. To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration we will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list In the example below, the expression appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries. The output looks similar to JSON and we will see this often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Easy peasy ;). . InfoDb = [] # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values #added records for my gender, phone number, and age InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Raunak&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Mondal&quot;, &quot;Gender&quot;: &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;September 1&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;raunakmondal07@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;PhoneNumber&quot;: &quot;858-923-6909&quot;, &quot;Age&quot;: &quot;15&quot;, &quot;Hobbies&quot;: [&quot;Programming&quot;, &quot;Programming&quot;, &quot;Programming&quot;,] }) #my partner info in dictionary InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Harsha&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Jai&quot;, &quot;Gender&quot;: &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;May 16&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;harshadevice@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;PhoneNumber&quot;: &quot;858-832-0156&quot;, &quot;Age&quot;: &quot;15&quot;, &quot;Hobbies&quot;: [&quot;Programming&quot;, &quot;Programming&quot;, &quot;Programming&quot;,] }) import getpass, sys ####User&#39;s input added to list### FirstName = input(&quot;Enter your first name: &quot;) LastName = input(&quot;Enter your last name: &quot;) Gender = input(&quot;Enter your gender: &quot;) DOB = input(&quot;Enter your birthday: &quot;) Residence = input(&quot;Enter your city: &quot;) Email = input(&quot;Enter your email: &quot;) PhoneNumber = input(&quot;Enter your phone number (with dashes in between): &quot; ) Age = input(&quot;Enter your age: &quot;) #for loop for hobbies, since want multiple outputs Hobbies=[] max_length = 3 while len(Hobbies) &lt; max_length: userHobby = input(&quot;Enter a hobby you enjoy: &quot;) Hobbies.append(userHobby) print(Hobbies) InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: FirstName, &quot;LastName&quot;: LastName, &quot;Gender&quot;: Gender, &quot;DOB&quot;: DOB, &quot;Residence&quot;: Residence, &quot;Email&quot;: Email, &quot;PhoneNumber&quot;: PhoneNumber, &quot;Age&quot;: Age, &quot;Hobbies&quot;: Hobbies, }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) .

Formatted output of Dictionary Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet or preparing it to be stored into a database. Also, it is a great way to exchange data inside of our own programs. . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. . InfoDb = [] def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Gender:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Gender&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Email:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Email&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Phone Number:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;PhoneNumber&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Age:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Age&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Hobbies: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Hobbies&quot;])) print() # for loop iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;Formatted for loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() . Formatted for loop output . While loop In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . While loop output . Recursion (calling a loop repeatedly) This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Recursive loop output .

            "title": "Raunak Mondal What Is Art   Tolstoy For Mrs. P's Class",
            "content": "from What Is Art? by Leo Tolstoy (1897) . CHAPTER 4 EXCERPT . If we say that the aim of any activity is merely our pleasure, and define it solely by that pleasure, our definition will evidently be a false one. But this is precisely what has occurred in the efforts to define art. Now, if we consider the food question it will not occur to anyone to affirm that the importance of food consists in the pleasure we receive when eating it. Everyone understands that the satisfaction of our taste cannot serve as a basis for our definition of the merits of food, and that we have therefore no right to presuppose that the dinners with cayenne pepper, Limburg cheese, alcohol, etc., to which we are accustomed and which please us, form the very best human food. . And in the same way, beauty, or that which pleases us, can in no sense serve as the basis for the definition of art; nor can a series of objects which afford us pleasure serve as the model of what art should be. . To see the aim and purpose of art in the pleasure we get from it is like assuming (as is done by people of the lowest moral development, e.g., by savages) that the purpose and aim of food is the pleasure derived when consuming it. . —- . Just as people who conceive the aim and purpose of food to be pleasure cannot recognize the real meaning of eating, so people who consider the aim of art to be pleasure cannot realize its true meaning and purpose because they attribute to an activity the meaning of which lies in its connection with other phenomena of life, the false and exceptional aim of pleasure. People come to understand that the meaning of eating lies in the nourishment of the body only when they cease to consider that the object of that activity is pleasure. And it is the same with regard to art. People will come to understand the meaning of art only when they cease to consider that the aim of that activity is beauty, i.e., pleasure. The acknowledgment of beauty (i.e., of a certain kind of pleasure received from art) as being the aim of art not only fails to assist us in finding a definition of what art is, but, on the contrary, by transferring the question into a region quite foreign to art (into metaphysical, psychological, physiological, and even historical discussions as to why such a production pleases one person, and such another displeases or pleases someone else), it renders such definition impossible. And since discussions as to why one man likes pears and another prefers meat do not help toward finding a definition of what is essential in nourishment, so the solution of questions of taste in art (to which the discussions on art involuntarily come) not only does not help to make clear in what this particular human activity which we call art really consists, but renders such elucidation quite impossible until we rid ourselves of a conception which justifies every kind of art at the cost of confusing the whole matter. . —-- . CHAPTER 5 EXCERPT . In order correctly to define art, it is necessary, first of all, to cease to consider it as a means to pleasure and to consider it as one of the conditions of human life. Viewing it in this way we cannot fail to observe that art is one of the means of intercourse between man and man. . Every work of art causes the receiver to enter into a certain kind of relationship both with him who produced, or is producing, the art, and with all those who, simultaneously, previously, or subsequently, receive the same artistic impression. . Speech, transmitting the thoughts and experiences of men, serves as a means of union among them, and art acts in a similar manner. The peculiarity of this latter means of intercourse, distinguishing it from intercourse by means of words, consists in this, that whereas by words a man transmits his thoughts to another, by means of art he transmits his feelings. . —- . The activity of art is based on the fact that a man, receiving through his sense of hearing or sight another man&#39;s expression of feeling, is capable of experiencing the emotion which moved the man who expressed it. To take the simplest example; one man laughs, and another who hears becomes merry; or a man weeps, and another who hears feels sorrow. [...] . And it is upon this capacity of man to receive another man&#39;s expression of feeling and experience those feelings himself, that the activity of art is based. [...] . Art begins when one person, with the object of joining another or others to himself in one and the same feeling, expresses that feeling by certain external indications. To take the simplest example: a boy, having experienced, let us say, fear on encountering a wolf, relates that encounter; and, in order to evoke in others the feeling he has experienced, describes himself, his condition before the encounter, the surroundings, the woods, his own lightheartedness, and then the wolf&#39;s appearance, its movements, the distance between himself and the wolf, etc. All this, if only the boy, when telling the story, again experiences the feelings he had lived through and infects the hearers and compels them to feel what the narrator had experienced is art. If even the boy had not seen a wolf but had frequently been afraid of one, and if, wishing to evoke in others the fear he had felt, he invented an encounter with a wolf and recounted it so as to make his hearers share the feelings he experienced when he feared the world, that also would be art. And just in the same way it is art if a man, having experienced either the fear of suffering or the attraction of enjoyment (whether in reality or in imagination) expresses these feelings on canvas or in marble so that others are infected by them. And it is also art if a man feels or imagines to himself feelings of delight, gladness, sorrow, despair, courage, or despondency and the transition from one to another of these feelings, and expresses these feelings by sounds so that the hearers are infected by them and experience them as they were experienced by the composer. . —-- . The feelings with which the artist infects others may be most various - very strong or very weak, very important or very insignificant, very bad or very good: feelings of love for one&#39;s own country, self-devotion and submission to fate or to God expressed in a drama, raptures of lovers described in a novel, feelings of voluptuousness expressed in a picture, courage expressed in a triumphal march, merriment evoked by a dance, humor evoked by a funny story, the feeling of quietness transmitted by an evening landscape or by a lullaby, or the feeling of admiration evoked by a beautiful arabesque - it is all art. If only the spectators or auditors are infected by the feelings which the author has felt, it is art. . To evoke in oneself a feeling one has once experienced, and having evoked it in oneself, then, by means of movements, lines, colors, sounds, or forms expressed in words, so to transmit that feeling that others may experience the same feeling - this is the activity of art. . Art is a human activity consisting in this, that one man consciously, by means of certain external signs, hands on to others feelings he has lived through, and that other people are infected by these feelings and also experience them . —-- . CHAPTER 15 EXCERPT . Art, in our society, has been so perverted that not only has bad art come to be considered good, but even the very perception of what art really is has been lost. In order to be able to speak about the art of our society, it is, therefore, first of all necessary to distinguish art from counterfeit art. . There is one indubitable indication distinguishing real art from its counterfeit, namely, the infectiousness of art. If a man, without exercising effort and without altering his standpoint on reading, hearing, or seeing another man&#39;s work, experiences a mental condition which unites him with that man and with other people who also partake of that work of art, then the object evoking that condition is a work of art. And however poetical, realistic, effectful, or interesting a work may be, it is not a work of art if it does not evoke that feeling (quite distinct from all other feelings) of joy and of spiritual union with another (the author) and with others (those who are also infected by it). [...] . The stronger the infection, the better is the art as art, speaking now apart from its subject matter, i.e., not considering the quality of the feelings it transmits. . And the degree of the infectiousness of art depends on three conditions: . On the greater or lesser individuality of the feeling transmitted; . | on the greater or lesser clearness with which the feeling is transmitted; . | on the sincerity of the artist, i.e., on the greater or lesser force with which the artist himself feels the emotion he transmits. . | The more individual the feeling transmitted the more strongly does it act on the receiver; the more individual the state of soul into which he is transferred, the more pleasure does the receiver obtain, and therefore the more readily and strongly does he join in it. . The clearness of expression assists infection because the receiver, who mingles in consciousness with the author, is the better satisfied the more clearly the feeling is transmitted, which, as it seems to him, he has long known and felt, and for which he has only now found expression. . —- . But most of all is the degree of infectiousness of art increased by the degree of sincerity in the artist. As soon as the spectator, hearer, or reader feels that the artist is infected by his own production, and writes, sings, or plays for himself, and not merely to act on others, this mental condition of the artist infects the receiver; and contrariwise, as soon as the spectator, reader, or hearer feels that the author is not writing, singing, or playing for his own satisfaction - does not himself feel what he wishes to express - but is doing it for him, the receiver, a resistance immediately springs up, and the most individual and the newest feelings and the cleverest technique not only fail to produce any infection but actually repel. . I have mentioned three conditions of contagiousness in art, but they may be all summed up into one, the last, sincerity, i.e., that the artist should be impelled by an inner need to express his feeling. That condition includes the first; for if the artist is sincere he will express the feeling as he experienced it. And as each man is different from everyone else, his feeling will be individual for everyone else; and the more individual it is - the more the artist has drawn it from the depths of his nature - the more sympathetic and sincere will it be. And this same sincerity will impel the artist to find a clear expression of the feeling which he wishes to transmit. . Therefore this third condition - sincerity - is the most important of the three. It is always complied with in peasant art, and this explains why such art always acts so powerfully; but it is a condition almost entirely absent from our upper-class art, which is continually produced by artists actuated by personal aims of covetousness or vanity. . Such are the three conditions which divide art from its counterfeits, and which also decide the quality of every work of art apart from its subject matter. . The absence of any one of these conditions excludes a work form the category of art and relegates it to that of art&#39;s counterfeits. If the work does not transmit the artist&#39;s peculiarity of feeling and is therefore not individual, if it is unintelligibly expressed, or if it has not proceeded from the author&#39;s inner need for expression - it is not a work of art. If all these conditions are present, even in the smallest degree, then the work, even if a weak one, is yet a work of art. . | NOTES: . We cannot use our personal tastes &amp; pleasures to judge the merits of something . | . Example of food defines that . Art can’t be defined by pleasure, but should be defined by its purpose . Defining anything as that which pleases us makes defining subjective &amp; out of the arena of art . | . Art can initiate a relationship between the artist and receiver . | . The feelings of the artist are transmitted to the receiver through art, but it is up to the receiver to assess that message . | . Art is a way of expressing one’s feelings to someone else using lines, shapes, and colors . | . The intensity of the feeling that the receiver receives is always less than or equal to the intensity of the feeling that the artist sends . | . Everyone will have a different feeling due to the differences between individuals . | . Sincerity is the most important of the 3. . | . These 3 conditions differentiate an art piece from counterfeit artpieces. . | . | . MAJOR TAKEAWAYS: . Art is a method of expressing someone’s feelings to someone else . | Art is mostly “infecting” rather than “expressing” because it can spread to multiple people who can different responses to it . | Counterfeit art describes art that isn’t individual, clear, or sincere . | . READING AND DISCUSSION QUESTIONS . Why does Tolstoy believe one must understand the aim or purpose of an activity as the key to defining it? . | Tolstoy believes that the aim or purpose of an activity comes from the necessity of it, not the pleasure of it. In addition, Tolstoy believes that understanding other concepts besides aim or purpose, such as the pleasure of it, can lead to subjective beliefs that could be considered irrational or irrelevant to others. . If, as explained in the chapter 4 segment, Tolstoy believes that pleasure is not the true purpose of eating, what then is? How does this relate to art? . | The true purpose of eating is to nourish your body and provide it with the nutrients that it needs to function properly. This relates to art because the true purpose of art is not to seek the pleasure that one gains from art, but rather to sense the feelings and emotions that the artist displayed in their art. . Why does Tolstoy compare speech with art? What does each communicate? . | Speech is similar to art because in the same way speech communicates thoughts and experiences verbally using words and sentences, art communicates emotions and feelings visually using geometric shapes and colors. In addition, speech and art both serve as means of union to many people. . Why does Tolstoy describe the transmission of emotion as “infection”? How does it differ from “expression”? . | Tolstoy describes the transmission of emotion as “infection” because the emotion transmitted from art can spread to others and can stay with the individual for a long period of time. The clearness of expression assists infection because the receiver, who mingles in consciousness with the author, is the better satisfied the more clearly the feeling is transmitted, which, as it seems to him, he has long known and felt, and for which he has only now found expression. . According to Tolstoy, but in your own words, what is art? . | Art is, according to Tolstoy, a “contagious” method of expressing someone’s emotions to someone else. Art is a human activity, consisting in this, that one man consciously, by means of certain external signs, hands on to others feelings he has lived through, and that other people are infected by these feelings, and also experience them. . How is what Tolstoy is saying similar to what the authors of Cultures and Values are saying when they explain that art has a “surplus of meaning?” . | Tolstoy is saying that art can have an intensity of feeling towards the receiver greater than what is being sent out if it meets his 3 criteria (which mainly can be described as sincerity). This is similar to what the authors of Cultures and Values are saying when they explain that art has a surplus of meaning because in a similar way, more meaning is being expressed from the art than being expressed in the art. . How does Tolstoy’s ideas support, challenge or complicate (both support and challenge) your ideas about art? . | Tolstoy’s ideas supported my idea that art needed to be sincere in some way to be considered non-counterfeit art, but challenged my idea that art was more about communicating feelings and emotions rather than drawing and painting in a way that seemed aesthetically pleasing. .",

            "title": "Apwh Notes From Prehistory To Rise Of Civilizations",
            "content": "From Pre History to Civilization .   . The first humans: appear in Africa. .   . The term pre-history refers to the period when written languages and records did not yet exist. How do we know about the pre-history period? . Archeology-the study of the ways of life of early people by studying what they left behind (artifacts) . Historians-study all evidence about the past, including archeology, written documents, pictures, films, etc. .   . The Stone age . The stone age is divided into two parts. . 1) 1)      Paleolithic (Old stone age) . 2) 2)      Neolithic (New stone age) .   . During the stone age, civilization had not yet emerged. People were pre-civilized. .   . NOTE: Problems with the term “civilization” . Historians and anthropologist have noted several problems with the term civilization. First of all, it tends to be used in an ethnocentric way; in other words, it is used to assign to others an inferior status. For example, the Chinese of the Han dynasty thought all others in the world were uncivil barbarians; likewise, from the Spartans to Nazi Germany, designating others as less than civilized was often a pretense for conquering or destroying them. Secondly, the term marginalizes (excludes) other people who have made important contributions to history. For example, nomadic people are responsible for the diffusion of some of the most important technologies in history, but most accepted forms of the term civilization exclude them. .   . At its most basic element, civilization is based on the food supply. Uncivilized man lives at the mercy of the land and weather. He does not provide for times of need. .   . “Three meals a day area a highly advanced institution. Savages gorge themselves or fast.” People lived at extremes: life was either a feast or a famine. There was little thought of providing enough food for the next day. .   . Hunting and Gathering . People grubbed food from the earth with their bare hands, then used simple tools made from stones or animal bones. Thousands of generations tried countless types of plants and roots, as man learned by experience which ones could be eaten. He gathered insects, small reptiles and small animals. Large insects were dried in the sun for future meals. Man is known to have eaten shellfish, frogs, snails, mice, snakes, dogs, horses, roots, lice, insects, .   . It was nature that finally taught man to save for tomorrow. People took example from animals and insects: dogs that bury bones, squirrels that hide acorns, bees that fill the comb with honey, ants that store up food in the hill. .   . This style of living is called Paleolithic. Its characteristics are: . 1) 1)      limited population group . 2) 2)      no permanent settlements . 3) 3)      social equality . 1. a.       no gender divisions: men and women both committed to search for food 2. b.      no separation of people according to occupation or trade. No hierarchies or social classes as we know of them today. .   . Paleolithic people have left us works of art that depict their lives. These are mainly paintings on the walls of caves. These served religious purposes; they were ways to bring good luck or the blessings of the gods on an up and coming hunt. .   . The change from Paleolithic to Neolithic societies . 1) From hunting to domestication of animals. . Instead of hunting, people learned to keep animals in a pen or pasture. Domestication: to tame something, to take it from the wild to live under the care of humans. Probably started when wounded animals were brought back to camp. It brought a more stable food source .   . 2) From gathering to agriculture . Perhaps the greatest discovery in the course of human history was the discovery of the function of the seed. Every plant has the ability to reproduce. This was probably discovered when some stray gathered seeds grew identical plants. Many historians believe women discovered the reproductive nature of seeds. .   . The Neolithic Revolution . The ability to acquire food on a regular basis drastically changed life: there was more stability and order. Life developed according to special patterns; they had to follow seasons. Religion worshipped reproduction and fertility. Aspects of nomadic life were given up. .   . Food production increase as people learned new ways of producing and storing more food. A surplus of food emerged. Surplus=having more than one needs, extra. .   . Results: . 1) This freed some people from having to spend all their time producing food. They could learn other skills. Artisans made weapons and jewelry. Specialty products could be made that were not available to nomadic people. .   . 2) Surplus of food could be sold or traded with other communities. Neolithic communities came in contact with other communities around them. .   .   .   . Changes of Neolithic Revolution: (Try to categorize these as social, economic, and demographic changes.) .   . 1) Probably the most significant change that took place with the Neolithic revolution was a dramatic increase in population. More food could sustain more people living together. . 2)  people needed to build permanent houses for protection and storing food .   . 3) People began to specialize in certain crafts, social divisions began, laborers/merchants . 4) Gender roles changed. Hunters and gatherers assigned similar roles to men and women. In the Neolithic revolution, the work that produced food became relegated to men, and household chores became the women’s job. Men came to be the dominant gender in society. .   . The Bronze Age . During this age people discovered how to use metals instead of stone. The use of metals (copper + tin = bronze) brought the Neolithic period to an end, although many of the skills learned during that time would continue .   .   . NOTE: The use of metals in early history . We call prehistory the Stone Age because most tools were made from stone. Slowly, early man learned to use copper from the ground. The problem with copper is that it is soft and easily bends; it will not keep a sharp edge. At some point, man learned to mix melted copper with melted tin to produce bronze. This technology (a learned technique or skill) produced a metal that was much more useful than copper or tin alone. Bronze could keep a sharp edge. But it was a technology that had to be learned. .   . The problem with bronze was that it was very brittle and would easily break upon contact with armor, bones or rocks. Soon, man learned to make a superior metal: iron. The production of this metal was more complex than that of bronze. Whereas bronze could be produced on an open fire, such fires were not hot enough to produce iron. Man learned to dramatically increase the temperature of fires by blasting air into the coals. This fed the fire more oxygen than it would get from a normal burn. With such fires, iron could be forged. .   . Weapons made from iron stayed sharp and easily shattered bronze weapons. Armies with iron weapons had a significant advantage over armies using stone or other metals. Because its production required additional technological skills, iron-making skills were kept secret by the Hittites who first learned how to make it. .   .   . Bronze was a hard, durable metal. It made better tools. . 1) Farming: food production drastically increased. This meant that people did not have to move around. They could stay in one place and build permanent homes. Once the problem of the food supply was solved, people could also group together in larger numbers and build cities. This is called urbanization. . 4) 4)      Weapons: Because people grouped together in larger numbers, more security was needed. Cities needed walls and large armies for protection. . 5) 5)      Government: all these changes made it necessary to provide more organization. Questions of “who is in control and will make the final decisions?” had to be answered. Kings emerged. .   . In short, The Bronze Age led directly to the birth of a new form of human organization: Civilization. .   . Civilization . The study of history begins with civilization. This is because civilized man has the ability to write things down, and these written records provide historians with clues about their lives. There are several things that make up civilizations: . 1) cities . 2) governments . 3) religion . 4) social distinctions . 5) artistic expression .   . The first civilizations in the world emerged in river valleys in China, India, Africa, and the Middle East. Here is a brief comparison of the river valley civilizations in Africa and the Middle East. .   . The River Valley Civilizations .   . A surplus of agricultural production led to the rise of complex human societies, or civilizations. With the need of agricultural societies to irrigate, it is not surprising that many civilizations emerged in river valleys. The River Valley civilizations that emerged on the Yellow River (China), the Indus River (India), the Nile River (Egypt), and between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers (Mesopotamia) made lasting contributions to civilizations. The following chart compares the important features of a few of these river valley civilizations. As you look over this, attempt to piece together what these civilizations have in common and what differentiates them. .   .   .         .   | Egypt | Mesopotamia | Shang | . Geography | Egypt was protected by natural barriers on all sides. The Nile provided the perfect waterway for trade. Also, the Nile flooded each year at about the same time, a fact that gave them a distinct sense of each year’s passing (they created the calendar to predict this). It also naturally fertilized the land and provided for abundant agriculture. Many people attribute the Egyptians’ optimism (eternal life) on the good fortune of its geography. | The Tigris and Euphrates Rivers flooded randomly and violently without much warning, a condition that probably contributed to their pessimistic view of the gods and fatalistic view of life. Also, Mesopotamia had no natural barriers protecting them from enemy neighbors. They were subject to constant invasion. The rivers facilitated trade and allowed some of the cities to grow quite wealthy. | China is geographically isolated. Although the Shang traded with other civilizations, their limited contact with others produced an ethnocentric outlook. They called their land the Middle Kingdom, an assertion that implied that other people were on the periphery of the civilized world. Their land was fertile and supported a surplus of agriculture without complex irrigations systems. | . Political | Egypt was united under one central government. Egyptians believed the king, or Pharaoh, was a god. This helped keep order because people were more inclined to obey the king if he was a god. Religious myths reinforced this belief. The government was strictly centralized and controlled the resources of the state. | Mesopotamian civilization was made up of many independent city-states that never were able to unit. This made them weak and vulnerable to invasion. However, sometimes the people had to unite to build irrigation canals for their agriculture. They developed written laws, the Code of Hammurabi, which was probably made to give unity to an expanding empire. | Most rule was local, consisting of a network of walled towns whose leaders were loyal to the king. These local leaders comprised the bureaucracy, a group of aristocratic chieftains who could be removed at the kings will. | . Society and Economics | Women had more rights than in most early civilizations. There were certain jobs, however, that women were not allowed to do. The most people in Egypt worked in agriculture. The Nile allowed Egyptians to trade with other civilizations and were in turn influenced by them. | The Code Of Hammurabi reinforced patriarchy and social distinctions. A business class of people operated quite independent of government control. Like in Egypt, most people in Mesopotamia were farmers. Certain cities traded and grew rich. We know they traded with Egypt and India. | The family was the most important social institution. Men had most all of the authority. As villages became more productive, social classes became more distinct. | . Religion | The Egyptians were polytheistic. The lineage of the gods extended to the pharaoh himself who had absolute power and was revered as a god. | The Mesopotamians were polytheistic. Each city-state had its own set of god that it worshipped along with a set of wider known gods. They built monuments called ziggurats to their gods. Their gods were often different manifestations of nature and were invoked to help in good harvests. Interestingly, the Sumerians viewed their gods as disinterested in human beings, probably a result of their unfortunate geographical allotment. | The honor and respect given to family elders was related to the worship of ancestors. Dead ancestors were summoned for advice through oracle bones and other means. Thus religion both drew from and reinforced patriarchy. | .   .   . Additional Notes: . The civilization in Mesopotamia, like that in China and Central America, is a rare example of a civilization that developed from scratch with no precedents to borrow from anyone else. | .   . The River Valley civilizations came up with many things we take for granted such as calendars, the wheel, alphabets, bureaucracies, divisions of time into units of 60, and complex mathematical concepts like square roots. | .   . Not all early complex civilizations had written languages (the civilizations of the Incas, for example.) | .   . Civilizations acquire new practices either through cultural diffusion (the Assyrians learned iron technology from the Hittites) or through independent invention (the Chinese bureaucracy). It is a good idea to know some more examples of these two ways. | .",

Derivation is here: http://www.flippingphysics.com/wnet-ke.html o This equation is always true. . | This equation is where kinetic energy is defined: KE = 12 mv 2 . | 0196 Lecture Notes - AP Physics C- Work, Energy, and Power Review (Mechanics).docx page 1 of 3 . Gravitational Potential Energy in a constant gravitational field is: Ug = mgh . | . h is the “vertical height above the horizontal zero line” and you have to always identify the horizontal zero line. . If you prefer the equation from the AP sheet, it is: ΔUg = mgΔh . The AP equation is the “change in” gravitational potential energy. . | . | | Energy can be neither created nor destroyed, so in a non-isolated system the change in energy of the system equals the sum of the energy transferred to or from the system: ΔEsystem = ∑T . If the system is isolated, no energy is transferred into or out of the system: ΔEsystem = 0 . The change in energy of the system is the change in mechanical energy of the system plus the change in internal energy of the system. ΔME + ΔEinternal = 0 . | The change in internal energy of the system is done by nonconservative forces or friction. In other words, the energy which is dissipated by friction goes into the system as internal energy. ΔEinternal = −Wnc . A nonconservative force is a force where the work done by the force is dependent on the path taken by the object. Conservative forces are where the work done by the force is not dependent on the path taken by the object. . | . | In other words: ΔME −Wnc = 0 ⇒Wnc = ΔME and because I don’t know of any forces which are nonconservative which are not friction: . | Wfriction = ΔME (is only true when there is no energy transferred into our out of . | . | | . the system.) . If the system is isolated and there is no work done by friction: . Wfriction = ΔME ⇒ 0 = ΔME = MEf − MEi ⇒ MEi = MEf . | We have conservation of mechanical energy. . | Which is only true when the system is isolated and no work is done by friction. . | . | Whenever you use Wfriction = ΔME or MEi = MEf you have to identify the initial point, the final point and the horizontal zero line. . | All forms of Mechanical Energy are in terms of joules, just like Work. . | . • Power is the rate at which work is done: P | = | W | | &amp; P | = | dW | | | | | | | | . | | Δt | | | | dt | | | | | | | | . | | | | | | average . | | | | instantaneous | | | | . | dW | | d . | ! | ! | | ! . | | ! ! | | | | | . | | | | | | | dΔr | | | | | | | . o Pinstantaneous = . | | = | | (F i Δr | ) = F i . | | | = F i v | | | | | | . | dt | | dt . | | | dt | | | | | | | | .

For gravity: Fg = − dUdyg  = − dyd (mgy ) = −mg (Force of gravity is always down) . | Neutral Equilibrium is where the Potential Energy of the object remains constant regardless of position. For example, a ball rolling on a level surface. . | Stable Equilibrium is where the Potential Energy of the object increases as the position of the object moves away from the equilibrium position and therefore the object naturally returns to the equilibrium position. For example, a water bottle being tipped to the side. . | Unstable Equilibrium is where the Potential Energy of the object decreases as the position of the object moves away from the equilibrium position and therefore the object naturally moves away from the equilibrium position.

A subscript is missing: Fg = mog where “o” stands for “object”. . | o All forces require two objects. This equation is the force of gravitational attraction which exists between the object and a planet. . § For us, the planet usually is the Earth. gEarth = 9.81 sm2 . • Any two objects which have mass have a force of gravitational attraction between them. This force is determined using Newton’s Universal Law of Gravitation. (The Big G Equation) . o Fg = | Gm1m2 | : G is the Universal Gravitational Constant. G = 6.67 ×10 . | −11 N ⋅ m2 | | | . | r2 | | | kg2 . | | . Requires two objects: mass 1 and mass 2. . | r is not the radius by definition. r is the distance between the centers of mass of the two objects. Yes, sometimes r is the radius. . | This equation is the magnitude of the force of gravitational attraction. The force is always directed toward the other object. . | . Thank you to one of my Quality Control team members, Frank Geshwind, for pointing out . | ! | = − . | Gm1m2 | ˆ . | | . that I should have talked about the vector form of this equation: Fg | | r2 | r12 . | | . § Note: rˆ12 is the unit vector from object 1 to object 2. | | | | | . | | ! . | = − . | Gm1m2 | ! . | | . § Some textbooks even use this equation: Fg | | r3 | r12 . | | | | . | ! | | | | | | . • . | Note the subtle change here. r12 | is no longer the unit vector and . | | | | | . therefore the cube of r needs to be in the denominator. J . • Setting the two equations for the Force of Gravity acting on an object on the surface of the Earth equal to one another yields this: . o | Fg . | = Fg . | ⇒ mog = . | Gmo mE | ⇒ gEarth = . | | GmE . | | | . | | | | 2 | | (REarth | + Altitude) . | 2 | | . | | | | r | | | | | | . | | | | | | | | | | . As long as REarth ≫ ΔAltitude the gEarth ≈ constant . . | . In other words, close to the surface of the planet, the acceleration due to gravity can be considered to be constant. We live in a constant gravitational field. . | The gravitational potential energy is then constant: Ug = mgh . | 0203 Lecture Notes - AP Physics C- Universal Gravitation Review (Mechanics).docx page 1 of 3 . When viewed from a frame of reference which is not on the surface of the planet, the acceleration due to gravity is not constant and we need a different equation: . | . o Universal Gravitational Potential Energy: Ug = − Gm1m2 . . r . This equation assumes a zero line which is infinitely far away. ( r ≈ ∞ ) . | This means Universal Gravitational Potential Energy can never be positive. . | This equation requires two objects. . | . § Note: This equation is not Fg = | Gm1m2 | r is not squared. . | | . | r2 | | | . The gravitational potential energy which exists between an object and the Earth in terms of the objects distance, r, from the center of the Earth looks like this: . | . . Assumes constant density Earth. (Which is not true, however, we often assume it is.) o Be aware the graph as shown above left has an incorrect part: . This cannot be correct because this implies an object would experience a change in gravitational potential energy of zero. . ΔUg = Uf − Ui = 0 − 0 = 0 (This makes no sense.) . | . | This implies it takes zero energy to move an object from the center of a planet to infinitely far from the planet. . WFa = ΔME = ΔUg = 0 (Again, this makes no sense.) . | . | This would mean the planet has a binding energy of zero; still makes no sense. . | I will be releasing a video with the correct solution soon. . | . | The Gravitational Potential Energy which exists between the two objects when the object . | is on the surface of the Earth is: Ug | = − . | Gmo mE | | . | | RE | | . | | | | . • What is the minimum amount of work necessary to completely remove an object from a planet if the object is resting on the surface of the planet? This is called the Binding Energy. Assume the object is moved infinitely far away, has zero velocity when it gets there, and there is no friction. .

Kepler’s 3 laws. I find having a basic understanding of the his first two laws is adequate, however, you need to know how to derive Kepler’s 3rd law. . | Kepler’s 1st Law is that orbits are elliptical and defined as such: . | . . Two foci at F1 and F2. . Each focus is located a distance c from the center of the ellipse. o Semimajor axis of length a. (Major axis of length 2a) . | | o Semiminor axis of length b. (Minor axis of length 2b) o r1 + r2 = 2a . o a2 = b2 + c2 . o Eccentricity of an ellipse is defined as c/a. For a circle c = 0 therefore eccentricity = 0. o The eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit is 0.017, which means its orbit is nearly circular. . Kepler’s 2nd Law states that a line between the sun and the planet sweeps out an equal area over an equal time interval. . The result of this is that the closer an object is to the planet during an orbit, the faster its orbital speed will be. . | | . Let’s derive Kepler’s 3rd law: We assume circular orbit. The only force acting on the orbital object is the force of gravity acting inward.

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts .
