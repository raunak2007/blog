|Category	|Expectation|	Explanation/Response|
|-|-|-|
|Program Purpose and Function	|Describes the purpose of the program, describes the program's functionality, and can take an input and return an output.	|The purpose of this program is to provide the user and specifically small businesses to manage their inventory and stock through a streamlined method of inventory organization
|Data Abstraction	|Shows how data has been stored in a collection and shows data from that collection as it contributes to the overall purpose of the program. |Identifies the name of a variable representing the collection being used and describes what the data contained in the collection represents in the program.	Our program abstracts data through data implementation which is accessed in a backend database. The purpose of this database is to store information about a user - be it their inventory, details, and stock - and these values should be able to be used in our program and construct a usable application where users can store and view details and inputs
|Managing Complexity	|Shows a collection of data that manages complexity. |Explains an alternative method that would have been more complex and explains why that method could not be used or how it would have to be written differently.	There will be a multitude of ways to keep track/organizing inventory. Whether it's searching for certain products, tracking location, or inserting details, the complexity is visible
|Procedural Abstraction	|Shows a student-developed procedure with at least one parameter that has an effect on the functionality of the procedure, and shows where that procedure is called. |Describes how the procedure contributes to the functionality of the program.	This will be found in each and every one of our features, as we will need to develop the right code in order for these features to work
|Algorithm Implementation	|Includes a student-developed algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration. |Explains how the algorithm works in detail enough to where someone could recreate it.	Listing inventory into a detailed table that stores the inventory's information will have sufficient algorithms to fit this criteria.
|Testing	|Describe two calls to the selected procedure in response 3c. Each call must pass a argument that causes different outputs. |Describes conditions being tested by each call. Identifies the result of each call.	We will test two different features in each section, which test certain conditions and output different results.
CPT
Each team member will be programming a special feature for the management system, so the individual create performance tasks will be focused on the respective features. For the n@tm project, we plan on intertwining each feature together to build one large application.

Coding my Feature
Using SQL, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Python...

User should be able to input inventory to keep track of their detailed product in a table
They should be prompted with a button to click on
Once clicked, the button should navigate the user to the attributes of the inventory, including things such as the data of input, user name, name of item, and quantity.
User should then be able to click another button that adds all this into a neat table for the user to view and refer back to whenever needed
A "delete item" button will be implemented to allow the user to get rid of the item if needed, and an "edit item" will also be implemented so that the user can make changes on the go.
Video Ideation:

I plan to show each aspect of the feature. The first is inputting an item into the table, with specified attributes. The next is editing the item once it has already been in display in the neat table, and finally, the delete item feature.
