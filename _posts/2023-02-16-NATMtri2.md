## Reflection (how it went)

I'd like to start off by saying I had a lot of fun and got to meet a lot of cool people. The projects I saw were amazing and, even though most were not 100% complete, it was very interesting to see such variety in just a couple classes. Focusing on our project, the TripleAJ Arcade, I think most people who came by were engaged and really liked the idea. I would've liked to have more of the features complete, obviously, but I'm glad we had a fairly working prototype (much better than last trimester!). I also visited other classes such as Digital Media Production, Photography, and 3D Animation. These all were very cool to check out as well, however some photos that I thought I had taken disappeared off of my phone. I got to see a lot of interesting art and hang out with a lot of people. Overall, 9.5/10 experience!
