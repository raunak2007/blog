I wouldn't notice anything when I looked at the question. The student may have clarified it elsewhere in their response, though. Additionally, I wasn't entirely sure where sequencing, selection, and iteration were located. I made an effort to find it, but I was forced to deduce it from the video.\n",

Function is the means through which it is accomplished. A card game of some form could serve as the function and the purpose could be enjoyment. Additionally, this same project did a poor job of explaining things.\n"

My project must be complete, with a variety of features and abstraction, in order to satisfy all the requirements. I think I understtod most of the topics but some of the things I got confused on were related to the identification of lists and parameters. Sometimes it can be hard to distinguish between them but overall I feel that I learned a lot of new information. "
