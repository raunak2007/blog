For example, there are procedures defined for create, read, update, and delete. This allows us to have a broad function which can be used to add information to specific rows of the database.\n",

These all need to be stored together, and using the code, we create a specific uid for the user which allows the rest of the data to be called from. The uid is essential in functions like update and delete, where data is removed or changed based on the user-specific uid.\n",
