<ul>
  <li>Enterprise: A project that is difficult/requires effort
    <ul>
      <li>Enterprise can always be improved, we can improve where we’re at</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Our life circumstances don’t matter as much <strong>as we think</strong>. Many different people (i.e those who’ve won the lottery)</li>
  <li>Intuitions: We can understand things without conscious reasoning</li>
  <li>Taking care of happiness doesn’t work without putting practices to work</li>
  <li>
<strong>G.I Joe</strong> fantasy: Simply knowing about a bias is enough to put the idea into practice</li>
  <li>Often, the mind mugs up about what it means to be happy. It often lies.
    <ul>
      <li>One case: Salary and our jobs</li>
      <li>Money</li>
      <li>Amount money needed to not up your happiness is around $70k</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Very happy people make time for social connections.
    <ul>
      <li>Connecting with humans helps happiness</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Helping others helps us a lot, and helps us be happy more</li>
  <li>Thinking about what we are grateful about is very powerful
    <ul>
      <li>Expressing gratitude is a very good</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sleeping is good</li>
  <li>Remaining in the present moment is often the best thing</li>
  <li>Savoring the moment is often better</li>
  <li>Affluence: The state of having a great deal of money (wealth)</li>
  <li>Be affluent in time (spending money)</li>
  <li>Happy people prioritize their time over their money</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Reflections</strong>: I often feel that I participate in some of these insights. I really like to help and remain in social contact with people, however I do not feel that I go out of my way to remain in contact. I also am not time affluent at all. This is sad because it doesn’t allow for me to be as happy as I’d like, so I feel that after watching this video I will be looking to focus more on my the time I have off (maybe giving myself an hour to myself, similarly to the Yale students)</p>

<h2 id="list-of-gratitude">
<a class="anchor" href="#list-of-gratitude" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>List of Gratitude</h2>
<p>People I am grateful for</p>
<ul>
  <li>My family (Sister, Father, Mother)</li>
  <li>My friends in San Diego</li>
  <li>My teammates</li>
  <li>My cousins back in India</li>
</ul>

<p>Goals</p>
<ul>
  <li>Get an A in all 3 trimesters the class</li>
  <li>Do extracurriculars related to my major (Computer Science)</li>
  <li>Create applications and apps</li>
</ul>

<p>These connect back to my happiness as they show my passions and keep me in the moment.</p>

<p>I’m grateful for my scrum team with Harsha, Yuri, Sachit, and Tanay. They’re all super smart people who cover all my bases when I can’t solve my problems. They perfectly complement each other and are genuinely amazing people to be around</p>
